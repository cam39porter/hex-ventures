# Validation/Iteration Roadmap
## Our Hypotheses
1. Professionals on average consume content unrelated to their job for a non-insignificant portion of the workday. 

2. Employees like consuming content and that behaviour is ingrained and not easily changable.

3. Enterprises have trouble regulating employee behaviour in a democratic, efficient way so non-work related content consumption is ignored for all intents and purposes.

4. General knowledge and insights that could prove valuable to a firm are not easily shared or shareable across companies.

5. Idea generation is not easily trackable.

## Testing the Hypotheses
To test these hypotheses, we plan on carrying out X interviews of professionals across Y different companies operating in Z industries. Our list of questions will:
* Focus on gaining more knowledge on daily employee behaviour
* Determine general practices put in place by companies to monitor employees (if any)
* Understand what kinds of things workers read, view, listen to during the workday
* Find out how knowledge and information is passed between employees in a firm
* (others)

## Ingesting feedback
We will take this feedback and incorporate it into how we design the product.

## Product Test
We should run two product tests.One internal and one using a partner company, preferably IRC, but can consider others if they are too busy.

The test will be done over two weeks for one hour a day. We will ask for feedback in a slack channel in real time, and after the test, explore the collective KnowledgeBases created to glean insights and determine what we can do to improve the experience.

We should plan to showcase our results of the product test at the Princeton startup competition in the from of:
* Visualization of linkages
* Number of times the employees used the service
* Tangible value gained
