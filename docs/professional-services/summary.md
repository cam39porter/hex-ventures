# Professional Services

## Background

Myles has been working as an independent contractor for a Consulting Company called Morgan Digital Ventures (MDV) for the past year and change. MDV’s client is a company called Data & Marketing Association (DMA), a 501c3 trade organization representing the data and marketing industry. Myles’ first project was to advise on a partnership between the client and a company called MetaX, a blockchain technology company based in Los Angeles. Through that assignment, he was exposed to this new technology and incredibly smart business minds and developers in the space. While the partnership ended up not materializing after 6 months of work, it inspired Myles to research, learn, invest, and create a solid network within the burgeoning space.

## Actionable Opportunity

As part of MDV’s scope of work for 2018, the company will be running the third annual Structured Innovation Program – a paid program that brings DMA members together to learn, collaborate and solve, as well as provide DMA branded thought leadership opportunities. This year, SIP will be focused on Blockchain technology and how Web 3.0 can help, hurt and disrupt current data and marketing companies. Instead of paying Myles as a 1099, MDV will simply begin to pay Hex Ventures as soon as the SOW is signed by the client. This will be our first real professional services opportunity. Hex Ventures will specifically be helping to run the program, advise and execute on programming, writing blockchain whitepapers, and meeting and educating industry players on what this new technology means for them.

## What’s Next

Hex Ventures hopes to parley this initial opportunity into more blockchain consulting work, leveraging our relationships with both DMA members and others who we proactively market to. The company plans on focusing mainly on educative and innovative consulting – helping centralized companies think decentralized.
