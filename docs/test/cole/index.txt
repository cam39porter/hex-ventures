Importance of arranging my desk to be efficient today

Always be stackranking, remember to prioritize your day each morning

It is essential to provide positive reinforcement whenever you see something good happening

I am noticing that taking time to write these things down is actually really ruining my flow

Seems like thoughts could be whatever the user wants them to be- we should have types that are user specified (maybe different than tags?)

WFH allows me to really be productive, its partly a placebo- but I just have so much time to get shit done

Capturing really interrupts flow- we will need to fix this somehow

No one will make the nodio reference- too complicated

I forgot how much ragers can get me going

Proper naming is one of the most important things when it comes to software development

static typing is always better in the long run #typescript

move runtime errors to compile time #typescript

my git pull command takes too long. It is extremely important to have quick build/etc. commands
