@nodio the social aspect of note taking gets at my core belief that friends are the first filter of the information you care about and should fundamentally inform how you think

@nodio when classpass realized they were on to something was when they started receiving letters about how the product had change their lives I want this to do the same by enabling people to have big ideas 

Classpass was making every reservation manually that definitely does not scale 

@nodio like classpass who fight to get users in the habit of exercise we have to fight to get users in the habit mental hygiene 

How do we play into one of the seven deadly sins? Reid Hoffman likes to invest in those @nodio

@nodio I want people to find in Nodio what I found in my journal 

@nodio the first question is how do you get users to make their first capture or to surface their first insight 

@nodio our hunt is get people to capture their thoughts and all ideas should.be in the table 

@nodio you should not feel like you have to take notes but compelled to do it because you get so much delight and value out of doing it 

series a, series b, and such are rounds of preferred stock equity financing 

In debt financing a company gives an investor a promissory note 

@nodio just wanted to screen shot a graph and associate to the other thoughts I have been capturing #feature #problems 

Warrants and options are contractual rights to purchase stock in the future. These are technically securities. A company is supposed to reserve enough stock to cover options that may be exercised

preferred stock has greater rights and preferences than common stock but is issued in the same fashion as common stock. Preferred stock holders get paid before common stock holders. Things like conversion, anti-dilution, voting rights, board seats, and liquidation preferences are common

Restarted stock is any stock with specific type of restriction on it usually in the form of transfer restrictions. Founders stocker, common stock are all usually restricted stock. 

Issued shares determine who owns what portion of a corporation where authorized shares determine how many total shares can be owned and exceeds the currently issued amount

Common stock is the general basic from of equity or ownership interest in a corporation

founders stock is the part of the stock issued to founders via a corporate resolution to issue authorized shares. This type of stock usually has a vesting schedule. Authorized shares can exceed the founders shares or founders stock and the founders still own 100 percent of the company 

Market value is the share price on the market

book value is the balance sheet value of shares

Share discount is when the share is below face value

share premium is when the price of the share is higher than its face value 

Issue price is the price at which the share is offered to the investor 

Par or face value of a share in the books 

@nodio every time I look at a note in notes app it reorders the notes and this means that they are slightly out of sync and cannot be rated to one another. Need to make sure that time clustering is possible which I think is enabled by have time nodes be a part of the networks architecture #nodes #architecture #features #problems

@nodio @platt how can you make your external hard drive as valuable as possible

@nodio can we create a lexicon of words or entities used by the user to create context for new captures that are put through NLP api so that they disambiguate to the same thing. This could be done by when a capture is inserted, the data processor searches elastic search for key words and gets captures that are similar on that. It then runs the inserted capture through the NLP api with the other captures fetched from elastic search so that the entities in them disambiguate to the same thing and there is more context

Bonus shares are shares given by the company to its shareholders

@nodio just realizing how long the list of thoughts I have generated so far and how with a traditional linear note taking app this kind of top of mind though capture does not work at all #problems #feature

Rights share are issued to existing stakeholders in a company 

@nodio maybe the desktop is the only place you can do the big visualizations #feature #viz 

Issued capital, subscribed capital, and paid up capital are usually the same value by the end of equity financing 

Paid up capital is the amount of the subscribed capital that has been paid for by the investor in cash

there is a certain amount of authorized capital which is issued capital for investors that then investors can subscribe to as subscribed capital

issued capital is the part of the authorized capital which is offered to investor

Authorized capital is the maximum amount of capital which can be issued by a company 

Subscribed capital is part of issued share capital which is accepted and agreed by the investor 

@nodio would be nice when you are doing mental hygiene on a network you are able to select a group of nodes and relate them all without have relate each of them individually 

Equity shares go in the liability side of the balance sheet

For an investor, these shares are a certificate of ownership in the company by virtue of which investors are entitled to share the net profits and have a residual claim over the assets of the company in the event of liquidation. Investors have voting rights in the company and their liability to the company is limited to the amount of investment.

In the world of financial and investment management, ‘equity share’ is a big word frequently used in every next discussion. We call it stock, ordinary share, or shares, all are one and the same.

The value of equity shares are expressed in terms of face value or par value, issue price, book value, market value etc.

@nodio just clicking the new note button with mouse instead of keyboard shortcut is too much effort and is dissuading me from use the notes app #problems #features

@nodio trying to read an article and just drop in highlighted text but that is too hard right now using notes app #problems #feature.      

Equity share is a main source of finance for any company giving investors rights to vote, share profits and claim on assets. #startup #finance

@nodio I would just love at the end of the day be reminded and do some mental hygiene and curate or delete the thoughts I have generated throughout the day. It would be an amazing reflective exercise and would allow to generate value from everything that you produce that may not be well formed or is just a question

@nodio I am realizing that I am using this a lot to capture questions I want to try to answer later but don’t have time do look into now but think would be interesting. I guess its really about just capturing interesting things that may or may not warrant a second look and further exploration. 

How did sriracha become ubiquitous 

@nodio how do you make a habit or practice of ideation because that is what humans are naturally good at that machines cannot do #brainstorm #differentiator

@nodio published content is awesome and you can do the how I got this thesis visualization of insights #school #university #students #thesis #viz

@nodio #Leo #plan told me that just making sure you capture thoughts and ideas that you can return later is important. Him and Darshan have run into the issue that they have had great ideas about certain integration but then never connect them to future thinking and ideas

@nodio I am spending a lot of time switching to this note taking app to write these thoughts it would be so much better as just hot key that pops up a dialogue box for capture. Also realizing for these thoughts the context is not that important #features #mvp #design

@nodio go through easy organic advertising by answering questions on Quora #seo #growth #platt

@nodio you can test hypothesis on Adwords for certain queries. You can run experiments this way. Is this the right audience for our app. We can test product fit. #seo #platt

@nodio how can make it so that is easy for people to publish their insights or thoughts. This is user generated content #ugc #growth #platt

@nodio the key at the start is word of mouth strategies and make it viral #platt #growth

@nodio how to we begin to position ourselves as a thought leader in the space with thought capture and reflection. Who is our audience. Who are the experts in this space. Creating reference material is the key

@nodio #platt linkedin does a good job of making content crawable so that profiles show up in google search #seo #crawling 

@nodio the best use of a blog is providing reference material on how the tool or app is being used especially when the content is generated by users or experts 

@nodio the benefit of consistent naming is that people know what they are looking at how to name things without thinking #organization

@nodio top students in a class monetizing their reading or thoughts or just the students thoughts from class that are actually attending class #pricing #subscription

@nodio a feature for universities should be read or annotating PDFs

@nodio by keeping thoughts small you can reorder and reorganize them by time or topic. In this way all the little thoughts can be put together in dynamic ways to create value for you instead of being stuck in a static form #notes #thoughts #differentiator

@nodio The best ideas don't die in the marketplace or in the laboratory; they die in the shower because people don't give themselves permission to write it on a napkin and take it out into the world. #mastersofscale #reidhoffman #endeavor

@nodio create growth council with thatcher, platt, and Rosser #seo #hacking

@nodio the challenge with current note taking is that it takes time to curate a note and when you want to take a note you are in the middle of something. It is much more natural to capture a thought as quickly as possibly with the recognition that later you will be reminded or guided to do some mental hygiene on them

@nodio insights should give you a sense of collaborative transformation

@nodio surfacing should give you a sense of delight

@nodio capturing should give you a sense of relief

@myles seems like lightning implementation to bring scalability and price rise #ether #btc #ltc

@nodio be aware of going to far with the vision because of black mirror association #platt

@nodio @myles instead of permission nd universal use group and global

@myles @nodio capturing is primarily about thoughts which can be text audio or visual. Context is the environment around that thought which a thought can annotate 

@nodio we should make it clear that what you capture should be uncharted and natural like a brainstorm 

Wonder if french presses could be easier to clean #coffee 

@nodio I feel fine not cleaning and honing my thoughts because I know I will surface them again and get to curate them #surfacing

Already with noting via this Nodio I feel.a sense of relief capturing things here because I know I will be reminded to go through later #nodio

Need to figure out the best way to involve as many talented friends as possible in this project #nodio

Growth hacking should be done with the small fire strategy and things that don't scale #thatcher #growth #nodio

The phrasing mental hygiene makes seem like a mindfulness practice #prescott #nodio

People illicit the most potent negative feelings of anger when they feel they have been treated unfairly #ted #values

We need to have a dedicated hashtag and mention button on the keyboard #nodio

We could use hyperbolic inventives, paying people immediately, to increase efficiency #nodio #ted
