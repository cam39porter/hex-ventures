@tangle the social aspect of note taking gets at my core belief that friends are the first filter of the information you care about and should fundamentally inform how you think

@tangle when classpass realized they were on to something was when they started receiving letters about how the product had change their lives I want this to do the same by enabling people to have big ideas 

Classpass was making every reservation manually that definitely does not scale 

@tangle like classpass who fight to get users in the habit of exercise we have to fight to get users in the habit mental hygiene 

How do we play into one of the seven deadly sins? Reid Hoffman likes to invest in those @tangle

@tangle I want people to find in tangle what I found in my journal 

@tangle the first question is how do you get users to make their first capture or to surface their first insight 

@tangle our hunt is get people to capture their thoughts and all ideas should.be in the table 

@tangle you should not feel like you have to take notes but compelled to do it because you get so much delight and value out of doing it 

series a, series b, and such are rounds of preferred stock equity financing 

In debt financing a company gives an investor a promissory note 

@tangle just wanted to screen shot a graph and associate to the other thoughts I have been capturing #feature #problems 

Warrants and options are contractual rights to purchase stock in the future. These are technically securities. A company is supposed to reserve enough stock to cover options that may be exercised

preferred stock has greater rights and preferences than common stock but is issued in the same fashion as common stock. Preferred stock holders get paid before common stock holders. Things like conversion, anti-dilution, voting rights, board seats, and liquidation preferences are common

Restarted stock is any stock with specific type of restriction on it usually in the form of transfer restrictions. Founders stocker, common stock are all usually restricted stock. 

Issued shares determine who owns what portion of a corporation where authorized shares determine how many total shares can be owned and exceeds the currently issued amount

Common stock is the general basic from of equity or ownership interest in a corporation

founders stock is the part of the stock issued to founders via a corporate resolution to issue authorized shares. This type of stock usually has a vesting schedule. Authorized shares can exceed the founders shares or founders stock and the founders still own 100 percent of the company 

Market value is the share price on the market

book value is the balance sheet value of shares

Share discount is when the share is below face value

share premium is when the price of the share is higher than its face value 

Issue price is the price at which the share is offered to the investor 

Par or face value of a share in the books 

@tangle every time I look at a note in notes app it reorders the notes and this means that they are slightly out of sync and cannot be rated to one another. Need to make sure that time clustering is possible which I think is enabled by have time nodes be a part of the networks architecture #nodes #architecture #features #problems

@tangle @platt how can you make your external hard drive as valuable as possible

@tangle can we create a lexicon of words or entities used by the user to create context for new captures that are put through NLP api so that they disambiguate to the same thing. This could be done by when a capture is inserted, the data processor searches elastic search for key words and gets captures that are similar on that. It then runs the inserted capture through the NLP api with the other captures fetched from elastic search so that the entities in them disambiguate to the same thing and there is more context

Bonus shares are shares given by the company to its shareholders

@tangle just realizing how long the list of thoughts I have generated so far and how with a traditional linear note taking app this kind of top of mind though capture does not work at all #problems #feature

Rights share are issued to existing stakeholders in a company 

@tangle maybe the desktop is the only place you can do the big visualizations #feature #viz 

Issued capital, subscribed capital, and paid up capital are usually the same value by the end of equity financing 

Paid up capital is the amount of the subscribed capital that has been paid for by the investor in cash

there is a certain amount of authorized capital which is issued capital for investors that then investors can subscribe to as subscribed capital

issued capital is the part of the authorized capital which is offered to investor

Authorized capital is the maximum amount of capital which can be issued by a company 

Subscribed capital is part of issued share capital which is accepted and agreed by the investor 

@tangle would be nice when you are doing mental hygiene on a network you are able to select a group of nodes and relate them all without have relate each of them individually 

Equity shares go in the liability side of the balance sheet

For an investor, these shares are a certificate of ownership in the company by virtue of which investors are entitled to share the net profits and have a residual claim over the assets of the company in the event of liquidation. Investors have voting rights in the company and their liability to the company is limited to the amount of investment.

In the world of financial and investment management, ‘equity share’ is a big word frequently used in every next discussion. We call it stock, ordinary share, or shares, all are one and the same.

The value of equity shares are expressed in terms of face value or par value, issue price, book value, market value etc.

@tangle just clicking the new note button with mouse instead of keyboard shortcut is too much effort and is dissuading me from use the notes app #problems #features

@tangle trying to read an article and just drop in highlighted text but that is too hard right now using notes app #problems #feature.      

Equity share is a main source of finance for any company giving investors rights to vote, share profits and claim on assets. #startup #finance

@tangle I would just love at the end of the day be reminded and do some mental hygiene and curate or delete the thoughts I have generated throughout the day. It would be an amazing reflective exercise and would allow to generate value from everything that you produce that may not be well formed or is just a question

@tangle I am realizing that I am using this a lot to capture questions I want to try to answer later but don’t have time do look into now but think would be interesting. I guess its really about just capturing interesting things that may or may not warrant a second look and further exploration.

@tangle the challenge with current note taking is that it takes time to curate a note and when you want to take a note you are in the middle of something. It is much more natural to capture a thought as quickly as possibly with the recognition that later you will be reminded or guided to do some mental hygiene on them

@tangle insights should give you a sense of collaborative transformation

@tangle surfacing should give you a sense of delight

@tangle capturing should give you a sense of relief

@Julian just had a great conversation about corporations as vehicles for innovation because they allow the individual to take risks without seeing the personal downside below zero. Like my grandpa told me in college, if you have nothing to lose it encourages you to keep on swinging for the fences

@tangle it is very compelling you begin to think of capturing things not only in terms of the value it creates for you but the value it creates for anyone you may be tangling with

@tangle since groups and users will likely be in the global namespace, it is likely that group names will end up being long and descriptive. For this reason it is likely quite important that we have good tab auto complete when you type @ for groups you are a part of users you commonly tangle with

@tangle since tangling is permissioned, does it mean that users won’t be able to attack people they don’t know directly.

drift happens immediately when communication decreases between individuals. Organizations need to try to mitigate this drift at all levels.

@tangle our product is a lot like meditative noting where by acknowledging and capturing a thought and then letting it go you are allowing yourself to be more productive and focused because your mind is not wandering off anymore #productivity #mindfullness #headspace 

@tangle tangles should be associated with the idea that we are the more the same than we are different and the ways we are different are equally interesting to both parties

@tangle the product plan should be guided by the emotions that we want each facet to evoke 

@tangle one of the facets is the metal hygiene and we want that facet to give you a sense of clarity and productivity and reflection from the chaos of thoughts generated through out the day

@tangle for each facet we have an emotion that guides. That facet can be implemented as a set of features. Those features can be broken down into two categories, prototype and MVP. Those features can be implemented with a set of technologies #roadmap #product #guide

... the challenge of how to maximise one’s individual earnings as a driver for a ride-hailing platform like Uber or Lyft is a pressing question that millions of entrepreneurs across the world now face. Anecdotally, many drivers spend a great deal of time strategizing about where and when to drive. However, drivers today are self-taught, using heuristics of their own devising or learning from one another, and employ relatively simple dashboards such as SherpaShare. @tangle users are self taught how to organize things in notes and they are bad at it or have bad heuristics for it #notes #problems

The fact of the matter is I have been investing tons of time thinking about start ups. Listen to podcasts on them. Reading books on them. Being a part of them. It would be silly to do anything but a start up. I love it.  

Why are there no podcasts and climbing the corporate ladder because climbing the corporate ladder is not as exciting as a start up especially when that start up is with friends 

The most important thing is to listen and ask questions when you are unfamiliar territory from those that are believable. There is no point seeming smart

Cole cares about burn rate which is good 

I believe in equal equity for founders personally. One idea is that Myles and I are discounted on the initial cash inflow based on the amount labor we have put in pre you two joining. 

I genuinely believe we are building unicorn and that there will be more than enough to go around. I want us all to enjoy that. I don't just want to get rich. I don't want to get richer than my friends. I want to get rich with friends. 

Getting drunk is a lot like getting rich. It is so much better to do with people you’ve instead of alone #quotes #friends

Main thesis from me would be that you and Myles should figure out what you want your 20s - 50s to look like, and make sure that your professional ambitions and approach to the company stay in line with your approach to life. By linking your personal, professional life and your friendships, any discord by nature of the design threatens all of the most important things in life all at once. Which is more or less the concept that small decisions now have big implications later (business, personal happiness, friendships, relationships all included)... For better or for worse. Making sure that what you do lands in the *better* side of the camp is the most important thing, in my opinion, for founders to focus on. #nick #business #friends #tangle

Price of the deal is one of the most entrepreneurs focus on #VC #deals 

Price per share is the ultimate measure of what is being pad for the equity, the price is often referred to as the valuation #VC #deals

Premoney valuation is what the investor is valuing the company at today, before investment. Postmoney valuation is simply the premoney valuation plus the contemplated aggregate investment amount #VC #deals

when discussing the valuation of the business verbally make sure to address the ambiguity between premoney and postmoney valuations as this demonstrates your basic knowledge and helps clarify the negotiation #VC #deals. The best entrepreneurs are presumptive that VCs mean premoney 

Company and the investor need to make sure that the company has sufficient equity (stock options) reserved to compensate and motivate its workforce. This is known as the employee pool or option pool #VC #deal

A typical option pool ends up in the range of 10 to 20 percent of the business and if the investor wants the pool size to increase this will be done prior to financing so the entrepreneur should be aware how this affects the premoeny valuation #VC #deals

You can either negotiate the option pool size or negotiate the premoney valuation or suggest the option pool increase is added to the deal postmoney #VC #deal 

VCs want to minimize their risk of dilution as much as possible by making the option pool as large as possible upfront #VC #deal. When you come to negotiate have an option budget

A warrant is similar to a stock option, it is a right for an investors to purchase a certain number of shares at a predefined price for a certain number of years #vc #deals. You exercise warrants

Warrants create a lot unnecessary complexity in center stage financing and headaches down the road #vc #deals

Warrant value is rarely calculated as part of the valuation event though it impacts the future allocation of proceeds in a liquidity event #vc #deal

In a bridge loan, warrants are common place #vc #deals. These occur when an investor is planning to do financing but is waiting for additional investors to participate 

In a bridge loan an investor makes an investment as convertible debt which will convert to equity at the price of the upcoming financing. Since this represents additional risk, the investor usually gets a discount price on equity #VC #deal

The best way to negotiate a higher price is to have multiple VCs interested in investing in your company #vc #deals

Down round and flat round are relative to the last financing round #vc #deals

Liquidation preference is the next most important economic term after price and impacts how the proceeds are shared in a liquidity event #vc #deals. This is important when the company is sold for less than the amount of capital invested 

Often times a preference exists in the form of a per share multiple on the investment before the common stock gets any consideration #vc #deals

Three types of participation, full participation, capped participation, and no participation #deals #vc

Liquidation preferences are traditionally set 1x capital invested #vc #deals

Liquidity event is an event in which shareholders receive proceeds for their equity in a company and it include mergers, acquisitions, or a change of control of the company #vc #deals

Capped participation means if the liquidation event returns the investor an amount that exceed the cap multiple the investors preferred stock is converted to common stock #vc #deals

Liquidation preferences across multiple series of financing can lead to overly complex structures #vc #deals

As a CEO you are constantly selling your vision to everyone at the company with every interaction #business #tangle

A term sheet expresses an investors interest in investing and the proposed terms of that investments

A terms sheet is usually 8 or so pages in length

Only two things matter in a term sheet economics and control

You can think in terms of the postmoney valuation

VCs do not usually gain over 50 percent control in a company but negotiate provisions that gives them control over some major decisions

Governance issues are complex when you have a lot people sitting around the negotiating table

There are many player in VC negotiations including angel investors, lawyers, and mentors 

the number of people involved can quickly spiral out of control especially if it is not clear who is making the decisions

Founders should not outsource their involvement in the financing to their lawyers

Entrepreneurs should have direct control of the process

The terms sheet will often reflect potential changes that will occur if a founder needs to leave the business 

Some VCs are not entrepreneur friendly and this usually becomes clear during the term sheet negotiation 

Most senior person at a VC is called a managing director or MD or general partner or GP. These titles often have prefixes such as executive managing director or founding general partner to significantly even more enormity. These individuals have final say and sit on the boards of the companies the firm invests in

Principals to directors are usually the junior deal partners below the GP or MD. This individuals require approvals from GPs or MDs. These are not final decision makers 

Associates are not deal partners at a VC but instead work directly for one or more of the deal partners. These people write tons of internal memos on potential investments and spend the most with the capitalization table which defines the economics of the deal

Analysts are at the bottom of the ladder and crunch number with no responsibility 

Ventures partners or operating partners at a VC are usually experienced entrepreneurs that have a part time relationship with the firm. They can sponsor deals

Entrepreneurs in residence (EIRs) are entrepreneurs with experience who park themselves at a VC firm while they are figuring out their next company. EIRs network for the company and do due diligence. The VC provides office, may pay them, and will have an implicit agreement to invest in their next company 

Always understand who at the firm you are talking to has the decision making power and what processes you have to go through to get the deal approved. Seek out other entrepreneurs who have worked with a VC for their advice 

Always insist on developing a direct relationship with an MD or GP

Angels are active in the first round of investment or the seed stage 

Pay-to-play and drag-along-rights are specifically designed to help VCs force a certain type of behavior on the angels and other VCs in difficult financing rounds

Angels should be accredited investors due to SEC regulation 

Super angles make many micro investments and are often former entrepreneurs with many connections 

A micro VC occurs when a super angle raises money and becomes institutionalized with their own fund. Although the want to differentiate themselves from other VCs once they raise outside funds they have the same fiduciary responsibility

Do not put yourself in a position where you can be held hostage by angel investors 

If you have a diffuse list of angel investors, consider setting up a special purpose limited partnership controlled by one of them to act to act as the vehicle for invest. This streamlines administration

If you allow family and friends to invest, make the sure they know their investment is a lottery ticket and every time you are together is not an investor relationship meeting

Some VCs invest alongside other VCs. A collection of investors is called a syndicate

A syndicate is often a reference to the major participants in a financing round. The syndicate refers to any entity or individual that ends up purchasing equity in the financing round

Mostly syndicates have lead investor that is usually one of the VCs. There can be co-leads

Lead investors often make it easier for entrepreneurs to focus their energy in the negotiation. The lead will negotiate on behalf of the entire syndicate

Always communicate with all members of the syndicate 

You need to make sure that all investors agree at least verbally that the lead investor can speak for the whole syndicate. Do not negotiate the same deal multiple times. Ask the lead investor for help if there is dissension

For an entrepreneur, an experienced lawyer who understands VC financing is invaluable 

An inexperienced entrepreneur runs the risk of getting hung up on a nuance that a VC has thought through many times. This is where a lawyer can help 

The real terms that matter are the economics and control. Often times there are endless negotiations over unimportant points and this is often used a negotiating strategy to distract you from the main show. Lawyers can help not fall into these traps

Inexperienced lawyers will get out negotiated and fight hard on things that don’t matter and thus run the bill up on both sides 

Always remember that once a deal is done, you are partners with your investors so you don’t want a bad or inexperienced lawyer creating unnecessary tension

Do not let a VC talk you out of using a lawyer that you want

An early stage financing round should have lawyer fees that do not exceed $15,000 and typical financing round should not exceed $40,000

If lawyers in VC deal do not agree to modest fee cap you should question whether or not they know what they are doing

You can insight that the lawyer only get paid out of the proceeds of the deal in order to align incentives.

Mentors are folks that operate like an adviser but do not have some sort of fee agreement with the company 

Mentors get a small equity grand fro being early angle investors in companies or get a small equity grant for serving on the board of directors or the board of advisers. 

We want Kevin Ryan and David Bradley as mentors on this project

Mentors are great and there is no reason not give someone a small success fee if they truly help you raise money. Sometimes it makes sense to compensate mentors with options as long as you have some control over the vesting of the options based on your satisfaction with the mentors performance

Goal when raising a round of financing should be to get many term sheets 

You must have the mindset that you will succeed on your quest and this needs to be clear to VCs. Do not say that you are trying to raise money or exploring options, say that you are raising money 

Attitude impacts outcome #quote

Before you seek out financing make sure that you have figured out how much you are going to raise

When thinking about how much to raise do not dive too deep on models rather focus on the a length of time you want to fund your company to get to the next meaningful milestone. How long to ship your first product or how long to get a certain number of users. Assume no revenue and determine what is your burn rate to get to this point 

Do not raise to much than you need since the worst position is over promise on what you considered the desired point of success 

Most investors love to be a part of an oversubscribed investment 

Never give a range of values for a raise. The first question will be what is the actually value

When you raise make sure you have an executive deck and peer station. Private placement memos (PPM) are common in later stage investments

Do not over design presentations and or executive summaries make sure there is enough content to latch on to while making the presentation solid

Investors like things that they can play with. Prototypes or demos are very desirable

An elevator pitch or a few paragraphs describing your business is needed for VCs. This is different from an executive summary which I describe the products, team, and business very directly. This usually what you send as the body of the email. This is often wrapped with an introductory and concluding paragraph with introductions and clear next steps

Executive summary is one to three page description of your idea, product, team,and business. This is the first substantive document interaction with a potential investor. This is the basis of your first impression and expect it to be passed around a VC firm if there is any interest in what you are doing

The presentation deck that you email as an overview can be different from the one you present as they are contextually different

Form of the slides in a presentation are important to a VC especially if you are designing a consumer product where user experience is tantamount 

If you do not have a good designer on your team hire one freelance or have a friend turn you presentation into something visually appealing

Most investor presentation can be done in 10 slides or fewer

Business plan is 30 page document that some VCs care about and others do not. This expands on the executive summary 

Although some VCs think business plans are a waste of time for raising, they are most definitely valuable for formulating their business 

A private placement memorandum is essentially a traditional business plan wrapped in legal disclaimers that are as long as the plan itself #ppm

PPMs are generated only when investment bankers are involved and are fund raising from large entities

If an early stage company hires a banker to help with fund raising it has often been unsuccessful on its own 

Financial prediction for startup are 100 percent wrong. The main value from a financial plan is the expense side and is very instructive on how you think of the business

Repurchase option allows company to purchase founders shares on termination #vc #deals 

for founder that seek funding after a year they could immediately vest some of their shares #vc #deals 

Invested stock typically disappears into the ether when someone leaves the company and get reabsorbed #vc #deals. Everyones shares get increased ratably also known as reverse dilution 

Explore the option of being able tp purchase your unvested stock at the same price as the financing if you leave the company #vc #deals

Single trigger acceleration refers to automatic accelerated vesting upon a merger #vc #deals

Double trigger acceleration refers to two evens needing to take place before accelerated vesting #vc #deals

Vesting should be viewed as an alignment tool for the founders and early employees #vc #deals

The employee pool or option pool is the amount of the company reserved for future issuances to employees. #vc #deals

VCs often try to increase the size of the option pool on a premoney basis #vc #deals

It seems like a smaller option pool is valuable as VCs will try to negotiate it up and this will also ensure that not too much equity compensation is given to employees during negotiation #vc #deaks 

Antidilution provisions are used to protect investors in the event a company issues equity at a lower valuation than in previous financing rounds 

Full ratchet antidilution means that if the company issues shares at a price lower than a then price for the series, then the earlier round price is effectively reduced to the price of the new issuance #vc #deals

Antidolution provisions usually generate a conversion price adjustment #vc #deals

Broad-based describes all common stock that could be obtained by converting all other options, rights, and securities to common stock whereas narrow-based does not include those #vc #deals

Carve-outs change the base of antitilditon provisions #vc #deals

“First, the existence of an antidilution provision will motivate the company to issue new rounds of stock at higher valuations because of the impact of antidilution protection on the common stockholders” #vc #deals

Control terms exist so that VCs can keep an eye on their investment as well as comply with certain federal tax statutes that are a result of the types of investors that invest in VC funds #vc #deals

One of the key control mechanisms is the process for electing the board of directors #vc #deals

Your board is your inner sanctum, your strategic planning department, and your judge, jury and executioner #vc #deals

Consider what is best: board members chosen by mutual consent of the board (one person, one vote) or voted upon on the basis of proportional share ownership on a common-as-converted basis #vc #deals. It seems that since our founder stock is diluted between four people it would be better for the founder to have voting be done on a one person one vote basis 

VCs will often want to include a board observer as part of the agreement #vc #deal. This is important because it is not often so much about who votes at board meetings, but who speaks. What if founders were board observers

Often times a board seat is given the CEO of the company which can mean that a founder can hold two seats and this seat can change if that founder is no longer the CEO #vc #deals

A typical board size for an early stage company is 5. One for founders, one for CEO, one for a VC, one for a VC, and one for an outside board member #vc #deal. With a more mature company that number could grow to 7 to 9

Outside board members are typically experienced entrepreneurs or executives in the domain in which the company is operating #vc #deals

Board members rarely receive cash compensation for serving on the board of a private company #vc #deals. Outside board members are usually just compensated with stock options just like key employees are often invited to invest money in the company alongside the VCs

protective provisions are effectively veto rights that investors have on certain actions by the company 


Standard protective provisions include changes in the terms of stock owned by the VC, authorization of the creation of more stock, issuing stock senior or equal to the VCs, buying back common stock, selling the company, changing teh certificate of incorporation or bylaws, changing the size of the board of directors, paying or declaring a dividend, borrowing money #vc #deals

Regardless of who your investors are, as it pertains to protective provisions, fight for them to have to vote as a single class. It keeps investors aligned and easy to manage #vc #deals

Board members are legally obligated to act in the best interest of the company. “Sometimes the interests of the company and a particular class of shareholders diverge. Therefore, there can be times when an individual would legally have to approve something as a board member in the best interests of the company as a whole and not have a protective provision to fall back on as a shareholder” #vc #deals

Protective provisions are not about trust but eliminating ambiguity in roles, control and rules of engagement #vc #deals

Sometimes protective provisions can be valuable like in an acquisition where a VCs protective provision ensures that a buyer has to offer a high enough price to entice the VC #deals #vc

A drag-along agreement gives a subset of investors the ability to force, or drag along, all other investors and the founders to do a sale of the company, regardless of how the folks being dragged along feel about it #vc #deal 

The issue with drag-along agreements is that if transaction occurs at a price below the liquidation preferences, the founders could see none of the value #vc #deals

With a drag-along agreement make sure that you are only dragged along when a majority of the common stockholders concept to the transaction no preferred stock holders #vc #deals 

Conversion means that at any time, preferred shareholders have the right to convert their stake into common stock #vc #deals. This allows preferred to convert to common should they determine on a liquidation that they would be better off getting paid on an as-converted basis rather than accepting the liquidation preference and the participation amount #vc #deals

In an IPO of a venture backed company, the investment bankers will almost always want to see everyone convert into common stock at the time of the IPO #vc #deals

Never let investors to negotiate different automatic conversion terms for different series of preferred stock #vc #deals

@tangle people want to know what they know. If they are writing a resume or applying to a job they want to know what unique things they should emphasize. They want to know the things they know that differentiate them. We could find exactly those clusters of thoughts that are unique to them so that they can emphasize them #features 

Private equity guys lobe dividends whereas VCs do not acre about them #deals #vc

Dividends can be paid in stock or cash #vc #deals

Investors could use the dividend as another form of antidilution protection #vc #deals 

“Mathematically, the larger the investment amount and the lower the expected exit multiple, the more the dividend matter” #vc #deals

Dividends should have to be approved by a majority or supermajority of the board #vc #deals

Redemption rights provide downside protection to VCs #deals #vc

Redemption rights exist in the case that a company becomes successful enough to be an ongoing business but not quite successful enough to go public or be acquired  #vc #deals

Can we use @tangle to see if you have a positive or negative affinity based on the thoughts that you capture #vc #deals

A typical VC fund has  a 10 year lifespan and thus if an investment is made later in the funds lifespan, the fund manager might want two ensure there is path to liquidity before the fund winds down #vc #deals

Never agree to an adverse change redemption clause as they are bad for entrepreneurs #vc #deals 

Term sheets are mostly nonbinding and VCs load them up with conditions precedent to financing #vc #deals. These can reveal the mindset of the investor 

“Note that the investors will try to make a few things binding—specifically that legal fees get paid whether or not a deal happens, the company can't shop the deal once the term sheet is signed, or the governing law be set to a specific domicile—while explicitly stating that a bunch things still have to happen before this deal is done, and they can back out for any reason.” #vc #deals conditions precedent to financing

Watch out for approval by investors’ partnerships as this is code for this deal has not been approved by the investors who issue this term sheet #vc #deals

Watch out for rights offering to be completed by company as this means that the VCs want to offer all previous investors int eh company the ability to participate in the currently contemplated financing #vc #deals 

Watch out for employment agreements signed by founders as acceptable to investors #vc #deals. 

Make sure to understand compensation and what happens if you get fired. A VC should spell out key employment terms at the beginning #vc #deals

Information rights define the types of information that VC legally has access to and the time frame which the company is required to deliver it to the VC #vc #deals

Registration rights define the rights that investors have to registering their shares in an IPO scenario as well as the obligation of the company to the VCs whenever they file additional registration statements after the IPO #vc #deals

Registration rights are about the upside and world is good if you are going public #vc #deals #ipo 

The right of first refusal defines the rights that an investor has to buy shares in a future financing #vc #deals 

The right of first refusal is also known as the pro rate right #vc #deals

With the right of first refusal pay attention to the share threshold that defines a major investor and see if there is a multiple on the purchase rights  which is called a super pro rate right and is an excessive ask #vc #deals

Voting rights define how the preferred stock and the common stock relate to each other in the context of a share vote #vc #deals

The restriction on sales clause, also known as the right of first refusal on sales of common stock (or ROFR on common) defines the parameters associated with selling shares of stock when the company is a private company #vc #deals this helps control shareholder base 

ROFR on common is a good thing for the company #vc #deals

Proprietary information and inventions agreement ensures that investors can stand behind the company and it legally owns intellectual property or ip #vc #deals #ip

Co-sale agreement states that if a founder sells shares, the investors will have an opportunity to sell a proportional amount of their stick as well #vc #deals

Founders activities clause states that a founder should 100 percent of their professional time on the company and anything else requires board approval #vc #deals 

Initial public offering shares purchase #vc #deals

The best way to get a good deal for a round of financing is to have multiple options #vc #deal, but a no shop agreement is almost always a part of the final term sheet 

A 45 to 60 day no shop agreement should be expected #vc #deal 

As an entrepreneur you should ask that the no shop clause expire immediately if the VC terminates the process #vc #deals also consider asking for a carve out for acquisitions 

indemnificiation states that the company will indemnify investors and board members to the maximum extent possible by law #vc #deal indemnify means compensate for harm or loss

You should have reasonable and customary directors and officers insurance for yourself as much as for the VCs #deal #vc

Assignment clause fives VCs flexibility over transfers that they require to be able to run their business #vc #deals you do need to make sure anyone on the receiving end of the transfer abides by the same rules and conditions as the original purchasers

A term sheet will almost always contain a summary capitalization table or cap table #vc #deals this summarizes who ons what part of the company before and after the financing 

Convertible debt is a loan that will convert to equity, usually preferred stock, a the such time as another round is raised #vc #deal this usually includes some kind of discount on the price to the future round 

Convertible debt means that you can avoid valuation as part of the negotiation and it has few if any rights like preferred stock offerings #vc #deals

One of the primary reasons an early stage investor looks to purchase equity is to price the stock being sold in the round #vc #deals 

In some convertible debt deals, investors will set a valuation cap #vc #deals a cap is essentially a line in the sand on the valuation of your company and you do not want that 

On convertible debt consider a reasonable time horizon on an equity financing and a forced conversion if that horizon is not met as well as a floor, not a ceiling, on the conversion valuation #vc #deals

The are two approached to convertible debt discounting, discounting the price at the next financing round and warrants #vc #deals 

Valuation cap is an investor favorable term that puts a ceiling on the conversion price of the debt #vc #deals

Convertible debt always has an interest rate associated with it #vc #deals

Convertible debt conversion mechanics are important #vc #deals and you do not want to get on the bad side of a debt holder  and can force nasty things like bankruptcy and involuntary liquidations 

If you have convertible and debt and the company gets acquired before a financing round then the lender gets its money back plus interest #vc #deals

A warrant is an option to purchase a certain number of shares at a predetermined price #vc #deals 

Acquiring companies hate buying companies that have warrants that service a merger and allow the warrant holder to buy equity in the acquirer #vc #deals

Warrants add a fair amount of complexity and legal costs to the mix #vc #deals warrants though completely avoid the issue of valuation caps that sometimes occur with discounts and convertible debt . An investor should never get warrants and a discount 

Convertible debt tends to be simpler and less expensive from a legal perspective than preferred stock financings #vc #deals however now the legal fees are comparable so the main force driving the use of convertible debt is to avoid setting a valuation 

Many states impose personal liabilities on directors for things that occur while a company is insolvent #vc #deals 

It Is vital to understand what drives your current and future business partners, namely your VCs, as their motivations will impact your business #vc #deals 

In a fund there is a management company that is usually owned by the senior partners #vc #deals. This company employs all the people with whom you interact with at the firm #vc #deals this is the franchise and what you see on the business cards 

When a VC talks about his fund, he is talking about a limited partnership vehicle that contains investors in the fund #vc #deals

The general partnership is an entity that entrepreneurs rarely hear of and this is the legal entity for serving as the general partner in the fund #vc #deals this is a legal entity that the managing directors each own on a fund by fund basis 


The arrangement between VCs and their investors is subject to a long complicated contract known as the limited partnership agreement or LPA. #vc #deals

When a VC has an opportunity it wants to invest in it makes s capital call to the investors or LPs #vc #deals

VCs slurries come from their funds management fees which are typically between 1.5 and 2.5 percent of the total amount of money committed to a fund, which are taken out annually #vc #deals this percentage is inversely related to the fund size . Thea average total fee over a 10 year period is about 15 percent of the committed capital 

The average VC raises a new fund every three or four years #vc #deals 

Senior partners of the VC firm or the ones with MD title see their base compensation rise with each additional fund #vc #deals 

It takes a decade to kill a venture capital firm because that is the length of the management fees associated with a fund #vc #deals 

The real money that ta VC makes is known as carried interest or carry which occurs when the investments are a success #vc #deals Most VCs get 20 percent of the profits after return capital to the investors 

The management fee for a VC can be viewed as a prepayment on the carry since it is in the VCs interest to put all of the money invested to work #vc #deals 

Older partners at a VC firm get more carry than younger partners #vc #deals which can be a major source of friction in the firm 

Historically there has been a 1 percent 99 percent split between GPs and LPs in a fund #vc #deals

Clawbacks occur when the VC takes the carry on an investment that returns early on in the funds lifecycle but by the end of the fund there are not returns over the initial investments to that carry is clawed back from the GP and given to the LPs #vc #deals 

VCs receive reimbursements from the companies they invest in for expenses associated with board meetings #vc #deals 

VC fund agreements have two concepts that govern the ability to invest over time. Commitment period or investment period, which is usually 5 years. Is teh length of time that a VC has for identifying and investing in new companies. #vc #deals Investment term is the amount fo time that the fund can remain active. Follow on investments can be made during the investment term.

Always ask a VC when they made their last investment and if it is over a year they are likely walking dead or zombies #vc #deals 

A secondary sale occurs when entire portfolios are sold to new firms and someone else takes over managing the portfolio through the liquidation of the companies #vc #deals

Always make sure you know how old a fund is #vc #deals the older the fund is the more problematic it will be in terms of pressure for liquidity or the need for the VC to distribute shares to a large number of LPs


Reserves are the amount of investment capital allocated to each company that a VC invests in #vc #deals Entrepreneurs need to pay attention to this. When a VC invests to well reserve a theoretical future amount of the fund to invest in follow on rounds 

Underreserving and overreserving occur when a VC doesn’t not accurately estimate the reserves needed for the fund #vc #deals this can lead to suboptimal behavior from the VC especially in the under reserving scenario where the firm will begin to pick favorites amongst its investments and attempt of Capital raised by a venture firm can be used for investments in companies, management fees, and expenses of the fund, which includes paying accountants for annual Audit, tax filings and paying lawyers #vc #deals

Cross fund investing is where VC firms invest out of several linked fund entities#vc #deals 

VC key man clause means that if a certain partner leaves the firm, LPs have the right to suspend the ability of the fund to make new investments or even shut down the fund #vc #deals

VCs have fiduciary responsibility to the management company, the GP, the LP, and each board they serve on #vc #deals

There are three things that matter when negotiating a financing, achieving a good and fair result, not killing your personal relationship getting there, and understanding the deal that you are striking #vc #deals 

Financing is only the beginning of a relationship #vc #deals 

Ask VCs to list there top three terms from the outset and be prepared to do the same #vc #deals

Kevin Ryan thinks that students are not the way to go at all. He thinks we should find 5 people like Dave, Minshew, and myself that really want this thing and would pay for it. He worries that what we are building could just be a feature of slack. He got away from that when I started sharing how we eliminate choice to empower people. 

Kevin Ryan  thinks we actually should not be organizing our information a system should be. 

Kevin Ryan  said we have two out of three things. One we are incredibly passionate about the idea. Two we have an exceptional team over very talented people who even in a pool of highly talented people are considered talented. The only thing we are missing is the are there people that would pay for this and if there are is this a thing where like budgeting even though you know you should do it you don't because the software doesn't actually make it easy enough. 

Kevin Ryan  said he does not take notes but knows he should there is just too much overhead to doing it. 

The lifelong brainstorm really resonated with Kevin Ryan.

We should reach out to Hannah Swenson because she is looking to do some new. 

Kevin Ryan is actually worried that we are budgeting for a two year timeline because we should really fail faster than that if it is not working. He is worried about the scaling the team too quickly but that if we can get these very talented technical people we should go for it. 

Kevin Ryan  thinks we really don't need any more business side besides Myles and investing in growth hacks are really just hacks that don't matter in the long run if the software is actually good. We should scale the technical team. 

Kevin Ryan  says the only successful software companies with founders under the age of 25 are social networks because those just require developers. It's when you need to start hiring a CFO or sales team that it becomes challenging to find good talent that wants to work with you. He said that he would start thinking of ideas for us such that if in 3 months this is not working he will have a project for our team or a direction.

 Kevin Ryan  thinks I am good at team building and leveraging my network. He said he would talk to his brother who runs Facebook workplace if there is is something they think about. We should define the actually personalities of the people that would use this and name them and act like they are real. We need to take it a level deeper than user stories.

I told him that my favorite part of this has been building the team, compelling talented people to come together and walk and then run in the same direction. I find this process very satisfying and find it exciting keeping people working towards a vision. #tangle #kevinryan

He said he would talk to his brother who runs Facebook workplace if this is something that is on the top of their mind. #tangle #kevinryan

@tangle We should define the actual personalities of the people that would use this and name them and act like they are real. We need to take it a level deeper than user stories. #tangle #kevinryan

Discussed equity structure with him. Mentioned 35 35 15 15 and less than a point for will #tangle #kevinryan

@tangle #jessinchauspe in the MVP it seems important to have the feature where your software creates cool insights/connections after the user has been using it for a few days. 

@tangle #jessinchauspe I’m wondering what “class” of notes you want people to input into Tangle. I personally would always keep my work notes in google docs, because i need to organize them by project and edit them into a document right there. 

@tangle #jessinchauspe So what is your market - is it people who write journals and want to digitize them? How about people who don’t write journals? How do you show them there is value in starting to take notes in Tangle?

@tangle #jessinchauspe Maybe integration with Evernote or Twitter are interesting to “seed” the user’s Tangle with a bunch of thoughts and instantly get valuable connections back. It might actually be an MVP feature. The quicker you get a user to see the value Tangle provides, the quicker you win them over (vs. saying: “please use Tangle for the next week, every day, and you’ll see in a week that we will return cool insights”. You’ll get massive drop-off there)

@tangle a good way to test your UX and design is to ask people to look at one of the wireframes and ask them what they would do next or how would you capture a thought #ux #testing you can even film them while they do this

@tangle in order to train our users to develop the habit of actively creating ideas. We can set a goal for the number of captures each day and then reward them when they make it. Over time we slowly increase the number of captures to keep them pushing their mental capacity. #features #journey #habit

@tangle create the ability to select a time frame and play back the captures during that period as visualization 

@tangle Many of us, to varying degrees, fetishize certain objects as having magical powers that enable, most often, creative processes. #creativity 

@tangle we are trying to help people build out what Steve Jobs spoke about in his Stanford commencement speech, “You can’t connect the dots going forward. You can only connect them going backwards” #connecting #inspiration #marketing

@tangle what we are building is very similar to Vannevar Bush’s memex machine that could be used to capture the memories and book of the owner #history #computing

@tangle it would be interesting if people create accounts whereby they curate a specific type of knowledge. Then anybody who joins that group could then gain access and make that knowledge part of their tangle just like the initial idea of the memex	

It's all about timing. Its about finding a parade and getting in front of it #mofs

@tangle its seems that it may be natural to allow capture to have types (questions, reminders, tasks) but this seems like a longterm feature and outside of our core focus #features

There are no growth hacks when building a startup and it is not about going through the motions of starting a startup. Its about building something people love and the rest just follows. You will figure it out. #paulgraham #yc #startup #tangle

IP assignment states that any IP you create over the course of your employment is owned by the company instead of you #ip #legal 

If you do not have a well-documented paper trail on IP, when they check your documents during due diligence (routine pre-transaction investigation into you and your company), fixing the paper trail will either cost you a lot of money and stress or it will kill the deal entirely. Don’t let this happen to you; get the contracts your lawyers give you signed, and then keep them in an organized and accessible fashion forever. #legal #ip

Founders that use Stripe Atlas to issue stock purchase their shares with a combination of money and IP. #legal

#tangle we should mitigate the perception that we have too many founders by creating a longer cliff thus by avoiding the downside of one of us leaving the company early #legal 

If a founder leaves the company before fully vesting, the company will elect to exercise the remaining portion of its repurchase right against any unvested shares the departing founder has purchase #legal Note that the amount paid to repurchase shares or options is not the current value, but the price originally paid for the shares—the repurchase won’t lead to a gain or loss

Just as contracts can define vesting schedules, they can also define criteria under which the vesting happens faster than otherwise scheduled. This is called acceleration #legal

An excellent reason to provide double-trigger acceleration for founders is to signal that it will also be provided to top employees, who are more at risk of involuntary separation in an acquisition and have very limited ability to extract favorable terms from the acquirer without backing from the founders

If you acquire property (such as stock) at a price below its fair market value, you will have taxable income on the difference between the fair market value and the price you actually paid for the property. One reason founders often purchase their stock immediately after incorporation is so the shares can be purchased when fair market value is par value. They can pay for a large number shares up front (at a nominal price) and have no income on the purchase. They will eventually owe income tax if they sell shares at a gain, but that is likely years down the road. #equity #legal #tax

The default position under U.S. tax law is that a founder has earned the shares (from a tax perspective, not a legal one) as of when that risk goes away, i.e., when the shares vest. This means that the “spread” between fair market value of shares and the price paid is calculated every time some of the shares vest. If the shares have increased in value before vesting, the shareholder might have enjoyed a paper gain on the difference between par value and the fair market value of the shares. This founder would ordinarily owe income tax on the income that that difference is assumed to represent… even if they cannot actually sell the shares yet #tax

Enter the 83(b) election: if you file the appropriate paperwork with the IRS within 30 days of acquiring stock, U.S. tax law will instead deem you to have acquired all of your shares when you paid for them. Thus the spread between the fair market value and the purchase price of your shares is calculated and taxed up front (when the shares still have minimal value), rather than as they vest, which will typically result in little or no tax liability. #tax #legal 

Low-touch SaaS is designed for the majority of customers to purchase it without sustained one-on-one interaction with a human being. #sales #tangle 

If you asked a low-touch SaaS entrepreneur for their most important metric, they would say MRR—monthly recurring revenue. #tangle #monetization

The SaaS model, fundamentally, works by financializing software: instead of selling software as a product with a sticker price, it sells the software as if it were a financial instrument, with a probabilistically forecastable cash flow #monetization #startup #tangle 

The core insight is really simple: one’s revenue, over the long term, is the number of customers times the average lifetime revenue per customer. #saas #startup 

The number of customers you get is a product of two factors: acquisition (how effective you are at attracting the attention of prospects in low-touch SaaS or identifying and getting in front of them in high-touch SaaS) times your conversion rate (the percent of prospects you convert into paying customers.) #saas

The average lifetime revenue per customer (often called lifetime value (LTV)) is the product of how much they pay you for a particular period (such as one month) and how many periods they persist using your service. #saas

The average revenue per user (ARPU) is simply the average revenue for an account over any particular period. #saas

The churn is the percent of customers over a given period who do not continue paying for services. For example, if you have 200 customers pay you in January and only 190 of those pay you in February, the churn would be 5%. #saas 

@tangle we need to track three metrics in real time acquisition rate, conversation rate, and churn rate #saas 

As a SAAS company you can ignore any cost that does not scale with the number of users. You do not care about cost of goods sold (CAG) by only customer acquisition costs (CAC) #finance #startup #tangle 

Your accountants will want your financial statements, specifically: general ledger: a list of all transactions for the corporation balance sheet: a summary of what the company owns and owe, income statement: a calculation of profit (or loss) #startup #taxes 

Your income statement (also known as the profit and loss statement or P&L) simply sums your revenue, expenses, and income (revenue minus expenses) for the year, broken down into coarse categories #finance #taxes

Fermi estimates are good ways to concisely demonstrate market size and quality of analysis #markets #startup #pitching

Bookkeeping is recording details about transactions to the books (ledgers) of the company. It has historically been seen to be work done by detail-oriented specialists, but not something which required a higher degree. #finances

Accounting turns the data from books into conclusions about the health of the business. Some of this function has largely been subsumed by computer programs—given that the books of the business are computerized, calculating e.g. a balance sheet (a report listing the present assets and liabilities of the business) is trivial. #finances 

The accrual method vs the cash method (when expenses and revenues occur from the customers perspective) is more complicated than the cash method. The tradeoff it makes is to allow the business (and other interested parties) to have a more accurate understanding of the true health of the business at any point in time.

@tangle we need to start with the accrued method of accounting #finances #vc #investments 

A business typically exists as soon as the person engaging in the activity says it does. The label business is simply a statement about intent: if you intend an activity to make money by providing goods or services to customers, congratulations, that activity is a business. #startup #conventions 

A company, on the other hand, is a particular operating structure registered in some jurisdiction. They come with substantial rights and responsibilities. #startup

Employees have their activities at work substantially controlled by the firm.  #employment #startup 

Contractors are operating their own businesses and happen to have the firm as a client of their business; their relationship with the firm is more similar to that of a vendor with their client than an employee with their boss #startup #employment

Startups are a curious alchemy of people, knowledge, money, and technology. Access to these building blocks has historically been grossly uneven, but is improving over time.  #quotes #startups #vc 

@tangle underpricing is far more common than overpricing a product #vc #pricing

Bookings is the value of a contract between the company and the customer. It reflects a contractual obligation on the part of the customer to pay the company. #finance

Revenue is recognized when the service is actually provided or ratably over the life of the subscription agreement. How and when revenue is recognized is governed by GAAP. #finance 

ARR (annual recurring revenue) is a measure of revenue components that are recurring in nature. It should exclude one-time (non-recurring) fees and professional service fees. #finance 

ARR per customer: Is this flat or growing? If you are upselling or cross-selling your customers, then it should be growing, which is a positive indicator for a healthy business. #finance

MRR (monthly recurring revenue): Often, people will multiply one month’s all-in bookings by 12 to get to ARR. Common mistakes with this method include: (1) counting non-recurring fees such as hardware, setup, installation, professional services/ consulting agreements; (2) counting bookings (see #1). #finance

TCV (total contract value) is the total value of the contract, and can be shorter or longer in duration. Make sure TCV also includes the value from one-time charges, professional service fees, and recurring charges.  #finance  

ACV (annual contract value), on the other hand, measures the value of the contract over a 12-month period #finance

Lifetime value is the present value of the future net profit from the customer over the duration of the relationship. It helps determine the long-term value of the customer and how much net value you generate per customer after accounting for customer acquisition costs (CAC). #finance 

ARPU is defined as total revenue divided by the number of users for a specific time period,  typically over a month, quarter, or year (annual revenue per user) #metrics #finance 

@tangle what if limited the number of invites people coil make so that it ensured they would only invite high quality people and they were rewarded by them converting to the premium version of the service

@tangle for businesses that follow the premium model it is important that the product have low marginal costs and minimal sales and marketing expenses

@tangle cohort analysis is key to the freemium model #models #pricing 

According to Daniel Kahneman we are really bad at planning (the planning fallacy) and we should look at the overrun on budgets of similar projects to estimate how much wiggle room we should give ourselves beyond what we think we should raise, possibly doubling it #funding #startup #planning 

According the Reid Hoffman you should always raise as much money as you can. You will need it all and it will allow you to pursue the the plan b pivots that inevitably occur. It also allows you to out maneuver your competition #funding #mofs
