# Coffee Chat Feedback Guide

> This document describes the guiding principals for how we seek out user feedback the coffee chat way.

We have three primary goals when seeking user feedback:

* Challenge our assumptions about our users and our product

* Save costly engineering cycles by discovering the features users want and axing the ones users don't before we build them

* Reveal our path to revenue by discovering what our users would pay for

We believe that there is a core truth at the center of every business. **Our core truth is that our thoughts have value; the more we can capture and connect them, the more of that value we can realize from them**. For every truth, there is a search space of possible products and solutions that a business could be built around to satisfy the given truth. As a startup, it is our job to explore this search space as efficiently as possible to discover the pockets of revenue and profitability. We believe these coffee chat feedback sessions can serve as a compass to navigate our chosen search space.

## Framing

> How we frame these conversations is key to how much value we derive from them.

We have three core components to how we frame a coffee chat:

* Be open, happy, and engaging. We want to reach a point of creative collaboration with the user.

* Negative feedback is the best kind of feedback. Be excited and dig deeper when we receive it.

* Emphasize how much we value their opinion. We are building this product for each user.

**We want to reach a state of collaborative play with the user.** If they feel comfortable and are enjoying the time, the quality of their feedback will be higher. In turn, this will help us explore the search space even faster.

## Questions

> These coffee chats are not interviews, they are conversations. This section is meant to provide some guidance on the type of questions one could ask. Ultimately, the questions we ask will be a function of the unique collaboration that occurs with the given user.

We use three primary types of questions to garner value feedback:

* Assumption oriented questions ask the user, "when was the last time you did X, and how did you do it?"

  * "What would prevent you from using our product?"

* Task-oriented questions ask the user, "if you wanted to do X, how would you do it?"

  * "If you wanted to do X, how would you do it now without our product?"

* Revenue oriented questions ask the user, "if a product or service were able to do X, would you pay for it?"

  * "What products or services do you pay for now and why?"

These types of questions should occur naturally over the course of the conversation. **It is our job to hone our skills to know when is the right time to ask each type to gain the most value and guidance from the user.**

## Post-Mortem

> A post-mortem is an analysis or discussion of an event held soon after it has occurred to determine why it was a failure. We call our feedback analysis a post-mortem because we believe that these chats reveal how our current thinking and version of the product is failing our users in some capacity. As such, we generate a post-mortem that identifies why it is failing and how we can move to a state of greater success in our exploration.

The post-mortem seeks to answer three primary questions for anyone reading it, regardless of whether they were a part of the coffee chat or not:

* How did this conversation change our assumptions about our users and product?

* If this user were our only user, what features would we prioritize and which would we stop building?

* What is the version of our product that this user would pay for?

Ultimately we are explorers. We have a core truth and some ideas about where we should go to make that truth into a thriving business. These users we chat with can serve as guides, pulling us through the search space faster and honing our compass. **It is our job to listen to them.**
