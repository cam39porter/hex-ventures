# Plan

[Plan](https://getplan.co/) is where we organize our worklife. Plan helps bring together all the tasks we need to complete in a single place, allowing us to focus on execution.

To this end, this guide is designed to outline best practices so that we can fully leverage the tool to get us to our goals faster.

## Structure

Plan has two primary structures for organizing **tasks**, the fundamental unit of operation in Plan.

1. **Lists** represent a related set of tasks. You can imagine that a *design* list would contain anything relating to design. Lists are named. The name of a list should be a single noun. Examples could include the following:

  * *Technology*
  * *Design*
  * *Administration*
  * *People*

2. **Projects** represent the state of the tasks within a list. You can imagine in a project having tasks that are *Urgent*, *Not Urgent*, *Ideas*. In fact these are the base set of projects every list should have.

  * **Urgent**: These are tasks that need to be completed first.
  * **Not Urgent**: These are tasks that will need to be completed, but are not urgent.
  * **Ideas**: These represent tasks that have yet to be formalized into actionable steps, require further thinking, or have a long time horizon.

## Tasks

As the fundamental unit of operation, it is important that we structure and engage with tasks in consistent way so that we maintain organizational coherence.

### Naming

The name of task should clearly articulate what needs to be done. This should be achieved use the following structure:

```javascript
[VERB] [NOUN_PHRASE]
```

An explanation of *noun phrases* can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noun_phrase)

What follows is a set of example tasks:

* `[Discuss] [Potential New Hires]`
* `[Create] [Vision API]`
* `[Write] [Strategic Analysis]`

### Assigning

Once it becomes clear who is best positioned to complete the task, it should be assigned to that individual.

### Scheduling

At the beginning of each day, we each should review the tasks pertinent to our roles and responsibilities within the organization. During this review, we should do the following:

1. **Assign** tasks to ourselves and others.

2. **Add** tasks that you believe can completed on the given day to the day's agenda.

3. **Create** new tasks, projects, and lists.

4. **Recategorize** tasks so that they are in the appropriate list and project.

Once tasks are added to the daily agenda within a list, they can then be scheduled for time slots during the day. This keeps the group informed on what we are each working so that effective collaborations can occur.

### Extras

* **Due Dates**: Each task can be given a due date. When a due date is assigned for a task that task will automatically be added to the daily agenda on the given date. Projects can be organized by due date.

* **Completion**: When a task is completed, mark it as done.

* **Meetings**: Meetings are created by scheduling an event, including the name of the list the meeting is related to in the title, and inviting the appropriate people. Logistical details should be included in the description of the meeting.

## Collaboration

As always, this represents a fluid document. Contributions and comments are appreciated to keep it in sync with the culture and habits of the organization as a whole.

The goal of this framework is to eliminate as many frictions as possible so that we can achieve at the highest level as a team.
