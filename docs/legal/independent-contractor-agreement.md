### Buyback Price Calculation

The following describes the calculation of the buyback price. Cameron Porter and Myles McGinley each invested $75000 for a 50% stake in Hex Ventures LLC. This puts the value of a 1% stake in Hex Ventures LLC at $1500. The buyback price for a 1.5% stake at $2250 is thus the same rate at which Cameron Porter and Myles McGinley bought into Hex Ventures LLC at.

## Notes

* *Vesting*: The vesting of equity will be determined when Hex Ventures LLC converts to a C-corp at which point all founders will be subject to the same vesting schedule.
