# Thoughts on Founder  Agreement
## Summary
This document serves to outline our thoughts on a founder's agreement among the founding members if Julian and Cole decide to join Hex Ventures full time. The document is subject to comment and change.

## Capitalizing the Business
Cameron and I are initially capitalizing the LLC with 75k each = 150k. We are doing this because we are committed to the cause and want to be able to act quickly if we need to do something that requires a capital expenditure. It also lets us rest easy that we have money in the bank, and not in crypto.

This capital will only be going to company expenses. We are not using that money for anything personal like rent or other general living expenses. We will be analyzing our burn rate weekly and will make real time decisions on if more crypto needs to be turned into cash for the LLC. 

Assuming Julian and Cole join the team as founders, we would expect them to budget for living expenses accordingly, and not rely on the Company funds for rent and other general expenses.

With regards to future capital contributions by founders, we are going to work this out. It will be a question for how we structure this with lawyers. 

## Expenses
* Food: we have budgeted for a $25 food per diem.
* Healthcare: Cameron is on his parents plan until next year. Myles is planning on paying for healthcare through the LLC. That option is open to all of us.
* Legal bills will all be paid by the firm

Any Company related expenses above $1500
need to be voted on as a group. This includes 1 time expenses or contractual/subscription based expenses that reaches that threshold over time. This threshold was calculated using a 2 orders of magnitude difference below our total budget.

## Capital Structure
We have a call with the lawyers next week (1/22) to discuss how best to set up equity among the founders that is comenserate with upfront risk/responsibility etc.

We will also be asking the lawyers how best to setup the founder's equity structure that reflects Cameron and Myles' upfront investment and leaves room for Cole and Julian to invest at a later date, but does not penalize anyone if someone has more to invest than another. It may involve two seperate, but similar, securities. 

##Governance/Decision Making
We believe a majority vote for "strategic business decisions" makes sense
* Capital raise
* Liquidation
* Mission statement

Cameron and I are actively seeking advisors.

## Board Members
Assuming this takes off, we will want to have a Board of Directors. We will make sure to bring this up with the lawyers when we have our call.
