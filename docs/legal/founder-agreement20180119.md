# Thoughts on Founder  Agreement
## Summary
This document serves to outline our thoughts on a founder's agreement among the founding members if Julian and Cole decide to join the Company full time. The document is subject to comment and change.

## Capitalizing the Initial LLC
Cameron and Myles are initially capitalizing the LLC with 75k each = 150k. Cameron and Myles are doing this because they are committed to the cause and want to be able to act quickly if they need to do something that requires a capital expenditure. It also lets them rest easy that they have money in the bank, and not in crypto.

## Converting to C-Corp
Assuming Julian and Cole join the team as founders, Hex would then convert the llc to a C-Corp to allow for the issuance of shares. And, if Julian and Cole want to join full time it most likely means Hex has been succesful in its infancy, so issuing shares would be necessary to bring on investors.

Converting to a C-Corp is easy and the upside from keeping it an LLC will most likely outweigh the legal cost of the conversion.

## Julian and Cole Working For LLC
Hex Ventures will draft up documents that will put into writing the agreement between parties. Hex will describe the following terms to the agreement: 
* Hourly wage
* Performance Metrics needed to hit that will most likely mean: "providing tangible contributions to the success of KnowledgeBase" and then define what success means: x,y and z
* Equity provided at C-Corp conversion if those metrics are met and if Hex converts to C-Corp
* How to dissolve the agreement

## Future Capital Contributions
If Hex converts to C-Corp, the corporation will issue common stock to the founders, and if a founder would like to  invest personal/leftover LLC capital into the C-Corp, it would most likely be done in the form of another security, and at a price per share that the founders agree on. Hex will ask their lawyers that question, but is not necessary under the LLC structure.

## Expenses
As an independent contractor working for the LLC, Hex Ventures will provide a 1099 form, which one can use to write off work expeneses.
