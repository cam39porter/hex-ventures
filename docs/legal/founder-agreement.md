# Summary of Founder Agreement

This document serves to outline our thoughts on a founder's agreement among the founding members if Julian Griggs and Cole McCracken decide to join the Hex Ventures full time. This document is subject to comment and change.

## Capitalizing the Initial LLC

Cameron Porter and Myles McGinley are initially capitalizing the LLC with 75k each = 150k.

Cameron Porter and Myles McGinley will provide further funding. This initial capitalization is intended to last until 2019.

## Converting to C-Corp

What follows assumes Julian Griggs and Cole McCracken choose to commit fulltime to Hex Ventures.

Hex Ventures would convert from an LLC to a C-Corp. This would allow for the issuance of share. This ownership model would facilitate outside investment.

Converting to a C-Corp is easy and the upside from keeping it an LLC will most likely outweigh the legal cost of the conversion.

## LLC Operations

Hex Ventures will draft documents that will put into writing the agreement between parties. Hex Ventures will describe the following terms to the agreement: 

* Hourly wage

* Sufficient performance standards for conversion to founding team member: "providing tangible contributions to the success of Hex Ventures"

* Equity provided at C-Corp conversion if those metrics are met and if Hex Ventures converts to a C-Corp

* How to dissolve the agreement

## Equity Structure & Capital Contributions

If Hex Ventures converts to a C-Corp, the corporation will issue common stock to the founders. 

If a founder would like to  invest personal/leftover LLC capital into the C-Corp, it would most likely be done in the form of another security, and at a price per share that the founders agree on. Hex Ventures will consult lawyers for further clarification.

The equity structure of the business including founder shares, shares for employee stock option programs, and outside investors is still being finalized.

It is the intention of Hex Ventures to have the following distribution with regard to founders shares:

* Cameron Porter 35%

* Myles McGinley 35%

* Julian Griggs 15%

* Cole McCracken 15%

## Expenses

As an independent contractor working for the LLC, Hex Ventures will provide a 1099 form, which one can use to write off work expeneses. 

Once converted to a C-corp, Hex Ventures is prepared to cover the follow living expenses of founders:

* $25 perdiem for food

* potential stipend for housing
