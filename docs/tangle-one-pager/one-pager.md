# Tangle

*Building our shared consciousness*

___

#### We ask everyone two questions:

1. Where do you capture your thoughts?

2. When is the last time you read through your notes?

> We have found that people capture their thoughts across a myriad of platforms and in many different ways: email-to-self, notes applications, documents, and more. There is also no easy way to search for what they are looking for, which makes surfacing old thoughts difficult or flat out impossible. This means that everyday, valuable thoughts slip through the cracks and good ideas are never surfaced. *We want to change that.*

**Our mission is to empower everyone to capture and connect thoughts to create big ideas.**

That's why we created **Tangle.**

#### How it works:
___

**Capture:** Have you ever had that sense of relief when you get that idea out of your head and onto paper?

> Get that feeling when you easily drop thoughts into your Tangle with our suite of tools:

* **Text:** Desktop keyboard shortcuts, mobile keyboard extension, highlighting, and annotation
* **Audio:** Native speech to text integrations
* **Image:** Screenshot and photo store

**Surface:** Have you ever had that feeling of delight when you don’t know what to search, but find exactly what you want?

> Get that feeling when you pull the ideas you want from your Tangle

* Query a simple search bar
* Visually explore your network of thoughts

**Tangle:** Have you ever had that feeling of excitement when you realize you and a friend are thinking about the same thing?

> The beginning of *pull social*

* Connect your thoughts with an individual or group to spur more spontaneous collaboration and ideation
* Search the collective Tangle like it’s your own

**Reflect:** Have you ever had that moment of clarity when you connect the dots between your thoughts?

> Live in that moment and develop the habit of active ideation

* Receive a daily digest based on your captures
* Revisit previous captures to help you contextualize and formalize your thoughts
* Hone the skill of reflection and creative thinking

**Inspire:** Have you ever had that *a ha!* moment in the middle of the night when the pieces all fall together?

> You'll get that * a ha!* every time you receive valuable analysis on your Tangle

* Visually explore clusters of thoughts 
* See the path of thoughts that lead to an idea
* Surface old thoughts related to new thinking
