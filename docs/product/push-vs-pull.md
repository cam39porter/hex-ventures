# Push vs Pull

> This document attempts to capture how a product like ours could a facilitate a transition from a push based ideation to one that is pull based.

## Benefits of Pull Over Push

> This section describes what push and pull based ideation are and the benefits of pull based ideation as compared to the traditional push based ideation.

**Push** based ideation has the following characteristics:

* **Broadcasting**: An individual thinks of an insight and decides whether or not to broadcast that insight to others via document creation and circulation, messaging, or conversation.

* **Acceptance/Rejection**: The recipient of the individual's insight decides whether to accept or reject the insight as worth their time.

In push based ideation, the individual that generates the insight feels societal pressure to decide whether or not broadcasting it to (pushing it on) others is worthwhile given the recipient may decide it is not a valuable insight. *In this way individuals may decide not to broadcast insights that may have proven quite valuable because we are poor at using internal heuristics to estimate the value of insight for others.*

**Pull** based ideation has the following characteristics:

* **Capturing**: An individual thinks of an insights and does not decide whether to broadcast it, but instead just captures that insight in a way that others can find it later if relevant.

* **Discovery**: Another individual is in need of an insight relating to a certain topic or domain, they discover the previously generated insight.

In pull based ideation, the individual that generates the insight does not feel societal pressure to decide whether or not capture it since they know it will only be discovered if another individual searches for (pulls) that insight given its topical relevance. *In this way individuals are incentivized to capture as many insights as possible as they no longer have to use internal heuristics to decide whether they are worthwhile as they will only be discovered if others are interested in them.*

## Why Knowledge Bases Facilitate Pull

> This section describes why knowledge bases as we imagine them facilitate pull based ideation over push based ideation.

**Traditional knowledge management systems** promote push based ideation in the following ways:

* **Broadcasting**: In traditional KMS, individuals decide to broadcast insights in files/folders, wikis, or messaging to potentially interested parties.

* **Acceptance/Rejection**: Recipients of these broadcasts express their acceptance or rejection of the insight since by broadcasting it the recipient is provoked to provide a response as to whether or not they are interested.

Traditional KMS promote the characteristics of push based ideation. In this way they force individuals to decide whether or not their insights are worth broadcasting. *This means that some potentially high value insights worth broadcasting are never broadcasted and thus never add value.*

**Our knowledge bases** promote pull based ideation in the following ways:

* **Capturing**: Our integrations mean that wherever an individual's workflows take them, there is a means to seamlessly capture the insights they are generating. Our backend systems mean that once captures, the insight and its context are connected to related content in the system.

* **Discovery**: Another individual is interested in a given topic or domain that is related to the insight that was previously generated. They simply query our knowledge base through a search bar and are presented with the relevant insight, discovering the insight when it is most pertinent.

Our knowledge bases promote the characteristics of pull based ideation. In this way they incentivize individuals to capture all insights whether or not they believe someone will use them. **This means that all potentially high value insights worth capturing are captured and thus have the potential to add value when individuals search (pull) and discover them**
