# Tangle vs Mesh

> This document describes a belief that tangle is a more fitting descriptor than mesh for our network of thoughts.

The issue with mesh is that it is too organized. A mesh is an organized structure. Although intricate, it lacks complexity. 

Tangles are complex. The idea of our product is to turn the complexity that the stream of conscious thoughts we experience into something emergent. It is the micro-interactions between disparate ideas that create patterns at the macro-scale. These reveal trends in thinking and ideation that are only possible when you allow the messiness to exist from the outset so that the little connections and collisions have room to occur.

It is not that our product is tangled and messy to use. It is that we are all a tangled mess of thoughts. Traditional notes hierarchal and *organized* nature do not reflect how we think. We think in fluid messiness, jumping from here to there. Our thoughts are all tangled in our head. If a system can play with our messiness, our tangled thoughts, and reflect their natural structure, it can provide more value for us than ever before

**Simply put, our thoughts are not a mesh, they are a tangle.**
