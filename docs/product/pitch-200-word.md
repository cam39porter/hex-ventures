We are building a product called Tangle to empower everyone to capture and connect thoughts to create big ideas. People let valuable thoughts and ideas fall through the cracks because they donâ€™t capture them at all or do but fail to resurface them when they are most valuable. How do we have time to keep track of this knowledge in the age of information overload?

Tangle allows people to frictionlessly capture top-of-mind thoughts in any format. Instead of keeping these thought captures in hard-to-search files, folders, or siloed applications. Tangle makes it incredibly easy to surface the knowledge you need when you need it. Using dynamic network visualizations of your Tangle, you can explore and reflect on your thinking.

Tangle with others to create a network of thoughts, a shared consciousness with a close friend, passionate group, or startup team. Experience the beginning of pull social, a new way to foster inspiration and collaboration that pushes back on the attention economy.
