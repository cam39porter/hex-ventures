# The Need for Third Parties

> This document attempts to capture when third party services are necessary and then how our collective knowledge base system is a needed third party service.

## When Are Third Parties Needed

> This section describes the market conditions that create a need for a third party, the ways in which third parties address those conditions, and then examples of successful third parties. Finally the core service of third parties is described. This section describes an ideal third parties.

Third parties are needed when these conditions are met:

* **Fragmentation**: In a fragmented market, many parties provide similar services or products with little differentiation. These parties compete to get consumers to utilize their product or service.

* **Biases**: Parties in a fragmented market carry biases about their product and service as well as how that product or service relates / compares to the products and services provided by other parties in the market.

Third parties address these issues in the following ways:

* **Unification**: A third party brings together the products and services of many parties into a single entity.

* **Unbiased**: A third party is not biased as to how the products or services of the various parties relate / compare to one another.

Ultimately third parties provides unified, unbiased, **discoverability**. Third parties can make decisions about what should be surfaced and when in a way that is optimal for the consumer instead of for the producing parties.

Examples of valuable third parties include the following:

* **Netflix**: The TV and movie is fragmented with many parties producing content. Each of these parties is biased about the relative quality of their content. Netflix unifies all content in a single entity. Netflix is unbiased as to who the content provider is. Netlfix provides unified, unbiased, discoverability.

* **Travelocity**: The airline industry is fragmented with many parties providing flights. Each of these parties is biased about the relative quality of their flights. Travelocity unifies all flights into a single entity. Travelocity is unbiased as to who the flight provider is. Travelocity provides unified, unbiased, discoverability.

* **Google**: The website industry is fragmented with many parties making websites. Each of these parties is biased about the relative quality of their website. Google unifies all websites into a single entity. Google is unbiased as to who the website provider is. Google provides unified, unbiased, discoverability.

## Why Are Collective Knowledge Bases Needed

> This section treats the firm as a market where individuals (employees) are the parties in the in the market providing the service of surfacing their knowledge on pertinent matters to the firm as a whole. We will look at how traditional knowledge management systems create the conditions where third parties are needed and then how a collective knowledge base can act as a third party and provide a valuable service.

Knowledge management within a firm operates like a market in need of a third party in the following ways:

* **Fragmentation**: Many individuals (or teams) in a firm produce insights or knowledge on similar topics. The parties compete to get their knowledge or insights used by the firm.

* **Biases**: Each individual or team is biased about how the knowledge and insights they produce relate / compare to the knowledge and insights provided by others at the firm.

Traditional knowledge management systems based on documents or a file and folder structure exacerbate the conditions that create the need for a third party in the following ways:

* **Fragmentation**: Many individuals (or teams) in a firm produce insights or knowledge and have different mental maps of how these translate to documents within the already existing hierarchy of folders. Each individual must decide whether to produce a new document in a new folder, add a new document to an old folder, or add content to an old document. This must be all done with the hope that others use the same implicit mental map to discover the content.

* **Biases**: Each individual or team is biased about how the knowledge and insights within the firm should be organized into documents and those documents into folders in order optimize for utility. Simply put, each individual given full control would organize the information differently. Each individual is biased.

The exacerbation of these conditions means that individuals establish thresholds upon which capturing new insights or knowledge is worthwhile given the overhead of determining where it should go and if it will even be used.

A collective knowledge base would address these issues in the following ways:

* **Unification**: As individuals leverage the various integrations (and API) to capture insights and knowledge within there preexisting workflows, they know that they have a single search bar where they can find the firms collective insights and knowledge.

* **Unbiased**: When individuals have an insight or generate new knowledge, they no longer make decisions about where or how that should be captured. They capture the insight or knowledge in the context of where it was created and the system handles relating / comparing it to other insights and knowledge produced by others within the firm.

The eliminating fragmentation and biases with the collective knowledge base system, individuals establish no longer create thresholds upon which capturing new insights or knowledge is worthwhile given the overhead of determine where it should go and if it will even be used.

**A collective knowledge base provides the service of unified, unbiased knowledge storage and discoverability. Collective Knowledge Bases can make decisions about what should be surfaced and when in a way that is optimal for the consumer instead of for the producing parties.**
