## The Knowledge Worker’s Dilemma

> Today’s knowledge workers need to be thinking and working like artists. Artists do not gain inspiration and begin creating from nothing. They are continually collecting tidbits from the world around them. These tidbits eventually become the catalyst for new artwork. Leonardo Da Vinci is a classic example of this. He collected thousands of moleskins worth of notes and inspiration, which turned into pieces of art like the Vitruvian Man and Salvator Mundi.

Knowledge workers will continue to make up a higher percentage of the global workforce as technology replaces the manual laborer. Competition amongst knowledge workers will only increase. The competition will grow because of the general increase in their population as well as the new remote work paradigm. Companies like TopTal are creating marketplaces for knowledge worker talent: from financial analysts to strategy consultants to full-stack engineers. Knowledge workers are the new norm, and to succeed, they need to act like artists: collecting, capturing, connecting, and reflecting on their thoughts - then turning those thoughts into knowledge, the asset that makes them, as knowledge workers, valuable.

Creating knowledge is not an easy task for knowledge workers for a few reasons.

1.  The modern knowledge worker does not have time for long-form note-taking. Throughout the day, the knowledge worker is doing something: she is reading, writing, creating documents in the Office suite, discussing, and collaborating. She then cooks or orders seamless, perhaps has a date, sees a friend and then goes to sleep.

2.  The modern knowledge worker is flummoxed by the paradox of choice when taking a note. Where should I write the note? In what file do I put this note? How should I organize it? She finds it difficult to decide where to capture a thought or take a note and does not often have the time to organize or find the notes already produced.

3.  When knowledge workers do capture their thoughts in a note, the notes they take and store are not dynamic. Digital note-taking applications today mimic the traditional pen-and-paper with the added benefit of text editing tools. There is no connective tissue between the things one writes. There has been recent activity from Evernote, in particular, to use AI to recommend tasks based on the user’s writings automatically. Evernote's usage of AI is interesting, but does not tackle the more significant problem: how to make it easy for knowledge workers (or anyone) to make connections between their trails of thoughts to inspire and surface new ideas.

The very act that reinforces and creates knowledge (reminder: a knowledge workers most valuable asset) takes time and is difficult to do: reflect on previous thoughts, ideas, and knowledge. The reason why this is hard is a function of problems 1-3, but providing a solution to promote reflection is another problem altogether.

The knowledge worker faces these three issues every day, whether they know it or not. As competition amongst knowledge workers continues to increase, these problems will become more and more amplified. Providing an application that can differentiate a knowledge worker by optimizing their primary asset will only increase in value.

## Solving the Dilemma

> Tangle is a personal knowledge management system. It is much more than a note-taking application. It is an extension of the mind and systematically addresses these problems for the modern knowledge worker. We will walk through how, in detail, here.

### Capturing

Thought capture needs to be incredibly easy. It should be so easy that there is a perceived cost to not doing it. Tangle’s text box makes capturing thoughts incredibly easy and fast. It feels more like you are texting someone or tweeting, rather than taking a note, which is purposeful. After all, this is how the modern knowledge worker reads and writes. Modern technology users often text and tweet in a stream of consciousness - which in essence is thought-capture. To further mimic this syntax, Tangle’s semantic capabilities allow for hashtags to denote further context. Tangle’s technology takes these tags into account when relating and storing captures (more on this to come).

Tangle offers more tools that make thought-capture seamless, especially for when the knowledge worker is in the act of content consumption: reading, watching, listening, etc. A browser extension offers a text highlight tool that automatically captures a bit of text on a page, as well as the context of that page (the website URL, page title, timestamp, etc.) so the user does not have to think about it while reading something of interest. The user also has the option of annotating that text to provide further information. Tangle also offers a picture clipping tool that operates similarly. Just right click the image and click capture in the drop-down menu. Tangle stores the image, parses it with computer vision, and extracts the context of that page to store it for you and make it searchable. Again, the user can insert an annotation. For video files, Tangle also offers a clipping tool that saves the exact time in the video the user wants to remember and again extracts the context. For audio files, Tangle allows the user to convert audio to text, and to store it for later with the context she needs. If the knowledge worker is on the go, she can speak into her device, and Tangle will capture it as well.

Tangle’s technology does away with the paradox of choice and the need for any kind of organizational hierarchy apparent in ‘files and folders’ or linear storage systems. This allows the mechanism and tools for capturing thoughts to function as a portal. The user captures a thought and presses `enter`. To find a specific thought she has captured, the knowledge worker searches her thoughts as she would Google. She inputs a term or string of terms, and Tangle surfaces what she is looking for along with her most related thoughts.

### Surfacing

Tangle transforms the knowledge worker’s thoughts into a network, one of Tangle’s core differentiators as a personal KMS. In addition to surfacing a list of the related captures, Tangle also shows the user a network of those captures on the same screen. Nodes represent captures and connecting lines show which ones are related in the visualization. We call this network a user's tangle. Instead of taking the time to search, locate, scan, and manually connect the dots in her mind, Tangle connects her thoughts for her. She can explore her tangle like she would view a map on Google Maps. This provides her clarity on what she is looking for and can offer insights she otherwise may have forgotten or never thought about in the first place.

While her captures are connected automatically, she can also filter the search based on hashtags she has used. She can use hashtags in a capture to denote a capture is specifically related to a topic, idea, or theme. Tangle clusters related captures together in the network but will become even smarter when the user purposely includes a thematic hashtag. The knowledge worker is comfortable with the hashtag as it is ubiquitous across almost every form of social media and is minimal work to help the system better organize the user’s trails of thoughts.

A KMS should surface essential insights and help a knowledge worker strapped for time and brain power to reflect on what she has captured - her trails of thoughts. Reflection and review are paramount to a knowledge worker’s understanding of a subject. Tangle is designed to promote the positive habits of reflection and active ideation.

Tangle has several features to promote reflection. The technology realizes when you are capturing thoughts related to a specific topic, either by keyword, context, or hashtag. It then notifies you of previous captures that are related. We call this surfacing.

Tangle users also receive periodic (daily / weekly) digests that provide a review of their activity. Similarly to how many applications provide “reflections” (Spotify’s end-of-year review, Grammarly’s weekly digest, Pocket’s digest), Tangle shows the user what they have been capturing, what they have been surfacing, and how their habits compare to other users. The digest suggests revisiting clusters of thinking related to what is top of mind for the user. This helps the knowledge worker gain real value from her capturing activity and helps them form the habit of reflection.

These product features help users to explore their network of thoughts and trails of thinking continually, ultimately reducing the number of ideas that fall through the cracks and increasing the number ideas created.

## Tangling, the New Pull Social

> Until this point, this essay has focused on the problems knowledge workers face, and how Tangle solves these pain points via a novel knowledge management system. Tangle, however, is social in nature. The product allows users to _tangle_ with others. Knowledge management can be personal, but it is incredibly important to groups of friends or coworkers who are always trying to tap into their tribal knowledge and know-how. Optimizing group thinking is, therefore, core to Tangle’s value as a knowledge management system.

### It Takes Two to Tangle

A user tangles with one or more people using `@mention` syntax. Every capture that `@mention`s a group or user connects to that group's or user's tangle as well as the capturer's. When surfacing their thoughts, the user can filter their tangle to see and explore those thoughts connected to a particular group. Users will also the see the other users and groups that they are tangled with who are most related to the thoughts they are viewing.

We are considering two more ways our users could tangle:

* Users may choose to tangle entirely with another user. When users do this, they create a single tangle that they both share.

* Users can capture thoughts with `@global` and those thoughts will become a part of the global tangle. The global tangle will operate as an open searchable network of unstructured thoughts for humanity.

### Pull Social

Currently, social media is _push_ in nature, which means that these platforms push notifications about new content, news, and advertisements to their users. This information is displayed in a linear feed of the most recently pushed content. This push social nature is a function of the attention economy where platforms collect data by addicting them to their platforms so that advertisers can serve them content. We hope to push back on this (no pun intended), by inverting the social paradigm. We call this paradigm _pull social_.

The user _pulls_ content from their tangle. For example, a group of friends create a group tangle called `@cryptocowboys`. Whenever anyone of the friends has a thought or idea about anything related to cryptocurrencies, they capture it and mention `@cryptocowboys`. In some ways, these captures are similar to tweets - they use hashtags, mentions, and resemble quick bursts of thought. Any of the users in the group can surface thoughts from the `@cryptocowboys` tangle. They can see how the captures of each user in the group relate to one another as well as how their personal captures fit in. The user can visually explore this network of thinking. The experience helps the user more intuitively understand how the group’s knowledge intersects and differs. It also helps the user visualize how the group's trails of thoughts have changed over time.

That is just scratching the surface. Tangle also pulls useful information from a user’s tangle and suggests exploring it further in periodic email digests. For example, if a user in the `@cryptocowboys` group captures thoughts containing `#ripple` and her friend in the group also captures several thoughts containing `ripple`, Tangle will surface that insight for both of them. Perhaps they should chat... While this is meant to be exemplary, recognizing opportunities for spontaneous collaboration, pulling these instances from the tangle, and providing them to Tanglers can be incredibly valuable.

### Pull vs Push

Pull social uses the user's current thinking and meaningful connections as a filter to expose content to a user. Captures that are related to their current thinking are surfaced for the user via daily digests or their own searching. These captures could have been made a year ago or by a fellow user they are tangled with. There is no newsfeed.

We believe this pull social nature will also make capturing more prevalent than sharing. Sharing in a push social environment like Twitter or Facebook is inherently an economic decision, where the user is forced to decide whether they ought to share something based on perceived personal and social utility of that post. Will the user be embarrassed? Will other people like it? In the pull social paradigm, the only way another user will see a capture is by searching for something related to the capture or by capturing similar thoughts. Since other users are looking for content related to the search terms they use and the captures they are making, it can be assumed that having a capture surfaced in this context will result in limited judgment. We consider this fear of judgment the primary threshold social media users consider before sharing content. We believe pull social helps lower that threshold.

Pull social _creates_ economic value for the user. It does not _derive_ value from the user. Push social environments, like Facebook, sell access to user data so advertisers can market and sell products and news outlets can entice views and clicks. The end-goal of push social companies is to take from the user and sell to third parties. Our goal is to help the user derive value from their thoughts.

While Tangle’s services are at this time centralized, we treat user data as sovereign. A user's captures and product usage belongs to the user. It is always exportable and deletable. We will never share it. The user is in control of their data. Fundamentally, we believe users should own their data and thoughts; we just want to help them organize them so that they can create the most value in their lives and the lives of others.

## The Paradigm Shift

Currently, personal knowledge management solutions are focused on skeuomorphic note-taking and storage. We believe this is a costly mistake. Knowledge management is much more than writing things down in a text editor and saving them in linear files and folders. In fact, it completely misses the point. Digital knowledge management should take advantage of its unique capabilities, not to mimic the physical world.

We can do much better than files and folders.

If we were to mimic anything, we should emulate how the brain works to design a robust knowledge management system. Thoughts should not be captured linearly in siloed documents. They should be free to collide and intermingle over time in non-linear ways. **Tangle breaks free of skeuomorphic note-taking and enters a new paradigm: where everyone is empowered to capture and connect thoughts to create big ideas.**
