# Tangle Tags

> This document describes the role of **tags** in **Tangles**.

## Individual

> This section describes the role of tags in an individuals Tangle. 

Each person has a Tangle. This Tangle is yours. A Tangle is a network of connected **captures**. Captures in a Tangle can contain tags. Take the following capture with two tags:

> Tangles are powerful for collaborating on projects #tangle #project 

In this case, the capture has two tags, *tangle* and *project*. These tags are used in part to connect captures in your Tangle. Other captures tagged with *tangle* are connected to the above capture. In this way, tags help to cluster captures in your Tangle.


## Group

> This section describes the role of tags in group Tangles.

A tag can have different levels of permissions. A tag's default permission level is private. A capture with only private tags is only a part of your Tangle. 

A tag can also be set to have a permission level of public. A capture with a public tag is part of your Tangle and the **Global Tangle**. The Global Tangle is made up of all captures by all users with tags with a permission level of public.

In between the permission level of private and public, there is a group permission level. A capture with a group tag is part of your Tangle and the Tangles of each member that has been invited and agreed to be a part of the group. A group can have multiple tags with group level permissions associated with it. 

You can imagine group tags being used on a team project. The team agrees on tags to use. They create captures as they perform research, brainstorm, and ideate. They are able to see how their captures are connecting to that of the group without any effort and can collaborate more effectively than ever before.
