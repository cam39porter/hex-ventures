# Product Guide

> This document is meant to anchor our thinking around the product in order guide us in the same direction.

## Overall Motivation

> This section describes what motivates us to create the product overall.

### Mission

> Empower everyone to capture and connect thoughts to create big ideas.

### Vision

> Building our shared consciousness.

## Facets

> This section describes the core facets of the product. Each facet of the product has a feeling that it is designed to provoke in the user or that motivates us to design it. Each facet also corresponds to a set features. These features are implemented with a set of technologies.

Before diving into the various facets we must define two terms corresponding the state of the product:

* **Prototype**: The version of the product we are happy using ourselves and giving to a controlled group of outside users.

* **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)**: The version of the product we are happy releasing to the public in an alpha capacity. The MVP is a superset of the prototype features.

### Capturing

> The act of ingesting a thought into our system.

* **Motivation**: Capturing should give the user a sense of relief. The burden is no longer on them to remember this fleeting thought and keep it top of mind. As thoughts arise, they can capture them and return to their current focus knowing the thought will be surfaced again for them later.

* **Features**

  * **Prototype**

    * Ability to capture a text thought on a desktop client

    * Ability to capture a text thought on a mobile client

    * Ability to mention other users or groups

  * **MVP**

    * Ability to capture a text thought along with context (highlighting)

    * Ability to capture an audio thought on a desktop client

    * Ability to capture an audio thought on a mobile client

    * Ability to capture an image thought on a desktop client

    * Ability to capture an image thought on a mobile client

### Surfacing

> The act of retrieving thoughts from our system.

* **Motivation**: Surfacing should give the user a sense a delight. The burden is no longer on the user to connect the dots between the thoughts they have captured over time and context of those thoughts. As needs arise, related thoughts are pulled from the Tangle on their behalf.

* **Features**

  * **Prototype**

    * Ability to search for thoughts on a desktop client

    * Ability to search for thoughts on a mobile client

    * Ability to surface related thoughts and users (degree of separation implementation)

  * **MVP**

    * Ability to filter on mentions or tags

    * Ability to surface related thoughts and users with more complex clustering algorithms

    * Ability to passively surface thoughts based on context (highlights)

### Tangling

> The process of connecting users via thoughts.

* **Motivation**: Tangling should give the user the sense that we are more the same than we are different, and how we are different is fascinating to all. The burden is no longer on the user to find connections between their thoughts and the thoughts of those people they are connected too. As their thoughts are surfaced so are the related thoughts of those they are connected to.

* **Features**

  * **Prototype**

    * Ability to use mentions to share thoughts with another users' Tangle

  * **MVP**

    * Ability to use mentions to share thoughts with a group of users' Tangles

    * Ability to share thoughts with the Universal Tangle (realized that global was planet limiting)

### Mental Hygiene

> The act of reflecting on, curating, and connecting the dots between thoughts at the end of the day.

* **Motivation**: Performing mental hygiene should give the user a sense of mindfulness and clarity. The burden is no longer on the user to define periods of time for reflecting. As thoughts are captured, the user is periodically reminded and guided through the exercise of revisiting those thoughts along with related thoughts surfaced from their Tangle.

* **Features**

  * **Prototype**

    * Ability to generate reminder and report (visualization and counts) of thoughts captured each day

    * Ability to perform basic curation and contextualization of thoughts

  * **MVP**

    * Ability to connect with users that have generated captured thoughts

    * Ability to customize report generation reminder timing and report style

    * Ability to perform more advanced curation like clustering or manually connecting

### Insights

> The analysis and visualizations generated by the system for the user.

* **Motivation**: Receiving insights should give the user a sense of realization and transformation. The burden is no longer on the user to analyze their notes and collaborate with others to experience these feelings. Instead, the system identifies patterns in thinking over time and potential opportunities for collaboration on the user's behalf.

* **Features**

  * **Prototype**

    * Ability to manually create and push and analysis/visualizations to users

    * Ability to visualize entire Tangle of thoughts and view clusters

  * **MVP**

    * Ability to filter by time of creation

    * Ability to adjust cluster size

    * Ability to generate topics for clusters

    * Ability to generate paths to thoughts

    * Ability to identify valuable collaborations
