# Myles McGinley Strengths and Weaknesses

## Business Characteristics

> List a set of characteristics that would be ideal traits to have for starting a business (not necessarily ones you have, looking for a laundry list here)

**indefatigable**: Has the stamina to keep trying even if failure occurs.

**persistent**: Has the will to keep trying even if failure occurs.

**persuasive**: Has the ability to persuade anyone of the value of thier pursuit. Very important for building the right team.

**hyper-confident**: There is a common phrase that a founder needs to either be a genius, incredibly arrogant or idealy both. I am not convinced that you need to be a genius or arrogant, just insanely confident in yourself and mission.

**visionary**: Sees the bigger picture as well as the road that gets them there.

**nimble**: If there is a bump in that road, they can quickly find another track that will help reach the same goal.

**able to take criticism**: always open to constructive feedback

**decision making**: one thing I witnessed first hand at my previous job was a founder was completely unable to make a decision when it was hard. Pushing out a tough decision is never the right choice.

## Domain Expertise

> List a set of domains that you feel you have expertise in (laundry list)

**investing generally**: All I did at Berenson was toil away on a rather complex venture capital deal that included both debt and equity. I am not claiming to be a great investor, just that I know how the process works.

**financial modeling**: just comes from doing it all the time at IB. Probably a bit rusty now.

**investor deck**: same thing.

**east asia**: I think this one is obvious.

**professional services**: I have been working in the field for 2.5 years both as consultant and investment banker. I understand our target buyer.

**event planning**: This is a weird one, but actually believe it is very importnat. One of the big things I did this past year was help plan thought leadership and social events for my client's members. I received good reviews.

**project management**: Essentially was just managing 3 core projects this year. I was both doing the work and the supervisor at many points.

**sales**: was part of the sales team for a rather uninspiring product on behalf of my client. Sucked at first, but ended up getting pretty good at pitching as I learned from my boss.

**real estate**: A subject I am very deep in.

**blockchain protocols**: particularly applications of TCRs. I'd say I am proficient in the technical aspects. 

**narrative creation**: Constructing a story around a product is incredibly important. It is what I did all day at my previous job and I feel like I am quite good at it. Always start with the WHY.

## Personal Strengths
> Describe some character strengths that you have that works well for founding a business (fewer and deeper answers)

**social intelligence**: I am very good at connecting, and making people like/trust me right away. `I think it has to do with the bald head and general perspicacity.` I think it has been something I have naturally been good at my entire life and has definitley helped me build a robust network of friends and professionals who would help me with something right away.

**malleable**: partially related to social intelligence, but I can make things work in any setting - not sure if this counts as "expertise" but is in my opinion one of my biggest traits. Put me in China, Brazil, Princeton, DC, New York, etc, I adapt to my surroundings more quickly than others. 

**jack of all trades**: I am good at a lot of things and have had exposure to a diversity of topic areas. I started in M&A where I was on the FIG team, information services team and real estate team, then was almost exclusively involved in digital identity data during my time as a consultant at my last job. In between that was attempting (unsuccesfully I will add) in real estate. I know a decent amount about a lot. 

**public speaking**: Want to get better at this, but have had a lot of opportunities to work on it this year and have improved a lot. Not just in a professional setting, but also in a social setting too. I have become the go to toast master. Who would have thought?

**generous**: I put the we before the I, always. My first question is always how I can help - which has gotten me in trouble sometimes because people, more often than not, will take your help when it is free and accessable. 

**fearless of new experiences**: this takes many forms, but it is most applicable to being a founder in a couple of ways:
1. I am not scared to learn something new.
2. I am not scared to fail at it.
3. I am not scared of criticism. Criticism is great - it means the person giving it to you believes in you and wants you to grow. I like to grow.

## Personal Weaknesses

> Describe some character weaknesses that you have, that would potentially hinder a business (fewer and deeper answers)

**inability to say no**: I am a *pleaser* at heart. There is always a trade-off between making people happy/keeping the peace/making the *right* choice. I am not sure exactly in what capacity, but I think there is potential for that to hinder a company in someways. 

**jack of all trades**: For all the same reasons why this is a strength, it can also be considered a weakness. I am good at a lot of things and have had exposure to plenty of different areas, but do not necessarily have a technical skill set that I am incredibly deep in. The jack of all trades but master of none saying.

**over trust**: I am susceptible to "over trust" people and because of that, I am can sometimes relinquish responsibility of thinking critically  about an issue or decision. There have been instances in the past where if instead of just trusting others to make the right decision, I could have added my two sense, and the outcome would have been more positive. 

## Core Motivations

> Describe some of the reasons why you want to start a company (fewer and deeper answers)

**I want to feel uncomfortable**: My entire life I have been comfortable. I have plenty of friends. I have never wanted for anything that I could not buy. I have always been able to play at the highest level. I have never *really* struggled in class (except for in calc 103, but at the time I thought I was going to try to go pro right after freshman year... didn't happen). So, I have always stepped up to the plate because I have always been comfortable doing so. Time to get out of that comfort zone.

**To provide**: I like to provide. I want to be in a position to shape a company; one that provides for its employees. I want to be in a position to shape a product; one that provides for its users. I want to be in a position to provide for my family, while there are obviously more than one way to be financially succesful, starting a company is a good one. Providing is the ultimate high for me.

**I want to work with the smartest people**: an offshoot of my first bullet, but working with the best, who are also sprinting at something, all together - and are most importantly my friends - is important to me and sounds amazingly fun and rewarding. This group provides that.
