**taking ownership**: I am good at taking responsibility for anything and everything. Whether it's a project that needs help, or any team problem is my problem.

**presenting**: I am not good at presenting information to a large group of people/I am not a good public speaker.

**sales**: I dont flow words together nicely on the spot, and I dont sound convincing when selling a product, let alone toilet paper.

## Core Motivations

> Describe some of the reasons why you want to start a company (fewer and deeper answers)

**Ownership** - One of the biggest reasons that I care less about my current job than I did at the beginning is that our team is much bigger and we have a suite of execs that call all the shots. Having full control over the decisions that direct my work is by far my biggest motivator.

**Work with friends** - I enjoy my friends’ company more than that of my work colleagues. I think a startup would be more fun

**Create value** - Create a product that brings as much value to as many people as possible. “Change the world…”

**Create an organization that cares about employee satisfaction and growth** - This is definitely far down the road, but I want to create a place that can cultivate the careers of its employees. This is part of my ideology to bring value to the world. I think one of the best ways to do that is to create a lot of value for a company’s worth of employees.
