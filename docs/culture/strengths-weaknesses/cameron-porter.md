## Personal Strengths

* **Learning / Growing**: I have always been a ravenous learner. I am hyper conscious of the information that I expose myself to and how it affects my thinking. I feel guilty if I have a free moment and I am not reading a book or listening to a podcast. I try to expose myself to ideas through what I listen to and watch (TED talks each night) so that I can challenge the way I think and be exposed to expertise and thinking of others in diverse domains. More over, I love the process of learning and the sense of growth that comes from it. I see not knowing something as an opportunity to learn it not as a hinderance. I rarely see not knowing or having experience in something as a reason to not pursue it as I believe I can learn it if I am willing to put in the effort.

* **Ideation / Creativity**: In the process of intentionally seeking out exposure to new ideas, technologies, and ways of thinking, I have become good and seeing the way thats that diverse domains could potentially intersect in interesting ways. I spend time each night journaling and actively curating my ideation. In this way I can see where interesting ideas come from and capture the moments of creativity we commonly call inspiration. In general, I love the process of thinking outside the box and looking at how given a set of constraints how can you creatively solve the problem.

* **Visionary / Compelling**: I think that over years (maybe its from watching all those TED talks), I have become good at speaking eloquently about ideas. I think that I can take even small things and wrap them in a compelling box for other to consume. I think that word games I constantly play with friends (like NvdV) have honed this ability. Beyond this, I think that I can feel how ideas and trends will affect us and then communicate those beliefs in interesting ways, creating metaphors and analogies to make those visions tangible now.

* **Determination**: Simply put, if there is something I want, I will put in the time and effort to achieve it. When I had my knee injury and the doctor told me it was most likely that I would not be able to play soccer again let alone at the professional level, I still wanted to play at the professional level. So I spent countless hours suffering through exercises on my own to fix my knee that I knew others would not have the willingness to do. I read books on suffering and habit formation so that I could learn the techniques that would enable me to maximize my discipline. In general, I hope this illustrates idea that when there is something that I want, I learn what I need to learn to achieve it and put in the time necessary to get it done.

## Personal Weaknesses

* **Empathy**: I often times have trouble communicating with other in an empathetic way when they are struggling with something I feel that there is a clear solution to. This is especially true when I feel as though they are avoiding learning or growing in some way that would enable them to solve it.

* **Introverted Learner**: Instead of asking for help when I could use it or it would save time, I often would rather go out on my own and bang my head against a wall until I figure it out. I think part of this is a desire to seem like I am self sufficient, prove my worth, or cover up things I struggle with personally.

* **Optimism**: I am often times overly optimistic and think that somethings that cannot (or cannot reasonably) be done can be. I think that this in part stems from the fact that I can create persuasive arguments about why something will happen or can be achieved. When I am analyzing things rationally and assigning probabilities to outcomes, I always need to be cognizant of this bias. Even more helpful is being around people who question my overly optimistic assessments.

* **Unemotional**: There are times when make statements or explain how I think about decisions that ignore their emotional nature. I think that this make me seem arrogant.
