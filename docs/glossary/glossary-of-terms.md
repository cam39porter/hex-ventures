# Glossary of Terms

## Motivation

We need to have a common lexicon as a team to ensure we are always speaking the same language. This will also help us compare and contrast our ideas on what the final product is going to be.

## Editing and (or) adding terms

I do not expect the initial list of terms and definitions to be final. For that reason, feel free to add a new term, edit an existing one, or add further clarification via subpoints. Please make sure to request a review when you create your pull request.

## General Definitions

* **Insight**: A thought that connects multiple ideas.

* **Non-actionable**: Something that cannot be used or acted upon, even though you have it.

* **Actionable**: Something that can be used or acted upon to achieve a goal.

* **Personal Knowledge Base**: The remembered experiences, learnings, ideas, know-how, and insights that can be used at any point.

* **Collective Knowledge Base**: The remembered experiences, learnings, ideas, know-how, and insights a group, which can be used at any point.

* **Note taking (noting)**: The act of writing, typing or copying insights / memory triggers from one you are studying onto a seperate document. 

* **Protocol**: A standard procedure or set of steps, in this case, to store user knowledge and insights in way that is usable.

* **Innovation**: a new, and importantly valuable, method, idea or product.

* **Collaboration**: The sharing and coordination of ideas, tasks, and processes between peers that lead to a desired outcome.

## Graph DB Definitions

* **Node**: a data point in a graph

* **Edge**: a connector between nodes

* **Directed Edge**: You can only go between nodes in one way and not the other

* **Undirected Edge**: You can go bidirectionally between nodes

* **Tree**: A subset/special form of graph i.e. minimally connected graph and having only one path between any two vertices. Trees start with a root node, and might connect to other nodes, which means that could contain subtrees within them. Trees are defined by a certain set of rules: one root node may or may not connect to others, but ultimately, it all stems from one specific place. Some trees have even more specific rules, like binary search trees, which can only ever have two links to two nodes at any given time.

* **Graph**: With graphs, there are no restrictions. There is no concept of a “root” node. Nodes can be connected in any way possible. One node might be connected to five others! Graphs also don’t have any notion of “one-directional” flow — instead, they might have direction, or they might have no direction whatsoever. 

* **Closeness Centrality**: a measure of a node's capacity to effect all other elements in the network

* **Betweeness Centrality**: How critical a node is to a network as a connection point. How many times does the node act as a bridge

* **Prestige Centrality**: Highly connected nodes count more than those wit ha lower degree of connectivity (page rank)
