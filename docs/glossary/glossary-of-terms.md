# Glossary of Terms

## Motivation

We need to have a common lexicon as a team to ensure we are always speaking the same language. This will also help us compare and contrast our ideas on what the final product is going to be.

## Editing and (or) adding terms

I do not expect the initial list of terms and definitions to be final. For that reason, feel free to add a new term, edit an existing one, or add further clarification via subpoints. Please make sure to request a review when you create your pull request.
