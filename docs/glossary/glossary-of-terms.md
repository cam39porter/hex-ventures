## Glossary of Terms

### Motivation
We need to have a common lexicon as a team to ensure we are always speaking the same language. This wil also help us compare and contrast our ideas on what the final product is going to be.

### Editing and (or) adding terms
I do not expect the initial list of terms and definitions to be final. For that reason, if you feel you would like to add a new term, or edit an existing one. Please make sure to request review when you create your pull request.
